# The One with the Recommendations

Hi and welcome to our app! The purpose is to take a few things that matter to you: Main characters, side characters, locations, keyword, etc and output a recommendation of 5 episodes of Friends!  There are two versions, one that uses a supervised technique and the other that uses an unsupervised on.  You can go directly to playing with these apps or you can first learn a bit more about how each one works below.
