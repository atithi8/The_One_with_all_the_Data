# The_One_with_All_the_Data


## combining_data.ipynb
This method combines a bunch of the CSV's together to create a nice CSV that tries to include as much information on the individual episodes as possible.  It includes the percent of the scenes that take place at big locations like: Joey's, Monica's and Ross's apartment as well as Central Perk.  It also does the same for percentage of lines said by each main character vs all lines in the episode (where a line is defined to be everything they said before a different person spoke).  It has which minor characters are in it, all of the credited actors, percentages of quotes, etc. So one may even think of this as the cleaning the dataset notebook more than analysis.
