4,10,8,7,because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?,
4,10,8,9,"okay, forget the specials for a minute. umm, all right here’s the thing, for the last two weeks i have umm, tried really hard to create a positive atmosphere…",[quietly]
4,10,8,11,"a positive atmosphere! but i-i-i have had it up to here. from now on, it is gonna be my way, or the highway! all right? does anybody have a problem with that?!! hey new guy! i said, does anybody have a problem with that?!","[louder] [she holds her hand over her head as an afterthought.] [joey looks at the money he’s holding, and doesn’t speak up.]"

4,15,2,14,how have you been?,
4,15,5,0,done?,
4,15,5,4,"this switch thing has been driving me crazy. so i turned it off and checked every outlet. now, four of them don’t work. which means, one of them has to be controlled by the switch. so, i plugged in things in all four of the outlets that-that make noise, so that way, when i turn it on i just follow the noise and find out which one it is.",
4,15,5,7,"yeah, well, i’m using noise. okay. all right! so, is everybody ready? here we go. i hear something! i hear something! where is it?",[she flips on the switch and a hum starts.] [they all start looking until rachel realises it’s joey.]

4,15,8,3,saucy!,
4,15,8,5,electrical plans for the building.,
4,15,8,7,"i know that switch does something, okay? so-so i went down to city hall and got these. all i had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours.",
4,15,11,1,hi!,
4,15,11,3,"oh, just some pictures i made and hung up. i thought they’d brighten up the place. they do don’t you think?",[rachel rips one of the wall and finds a huge hole underneath.]
4,15,11,4,"no-no-no, no!","[rachel rips off another one, revealing another hole. rachel then moves onto a third one, but this one doesn’t have a hole underneath it.]"
4,15,11,5,"i know that there’s no hole there, i just really liked that picture.","[rachel looks at it and then throws it away. she then removes a fourth one, revealing a third hole.]"
4,15,11,7,"okay, but there is a wire back there! i mean that switch is connected to something!",
4,15,11,9,i just thought that if i could follow the wire i could find out what it did.,
4,15,11,11,"no. it disappears back there behind that baseboard. for a minute there, i thought it went downstairs.",[rachel removes a paper on the floor which is covering a hole and gasps.]
4,15,11,12,but it didn’t. say hello to mrs. chatracus.,
4,15,14,0,all right. the super couldn’t figure out what it did. a $200 an hour electrician couldn’t figure out what it did. i’ve had seven pretty serious shocks. i officially give up.,
4,15,14,2,"i guess joey was right, it does nothing.","[cut to chandler and joey’s, joey and phoebe are watching tv. the tv is turning off and on, and each time phoebe is blinking her eyes like the genie did. the switch obviously controls the outlet which the tv is plugged into.]"

5,8,11,50,"oh yeah, of course. i'm fine it's just that—","[she drops the box and in a reflex action tries to catch it with her arm, the knife slips out and slowly flips through the air and comes point first down into chandler's shoe.]"

5,16,7,23,no!,
5,16,7,26,"or, it could mean that-that you saw chandler and me together and we y'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too.",
5,16,7,28,um-hmm.,
5,16,7,32,"well sure! i'm just wearing sweats! but that's good that you're not in love with me, because you just want a girlfriend!",[looking at chandler and slowly realizing what his point is.]
5,16,7,36,you become friends after?,
5,16,7,40,that's right.,"[laughing] [they realize the implication of their behavior, stop instantly and head for his bedroom. in the meanwhile, joey is starring at rachel in a seductive way.]"
5,16,11,5,"joey, i thought you were gonna try to be friends first!",
5,16,11,9,what about the closeness?,
5,16,12,3,who is it?,
5,17,1,16,let me try.,[gets up to join them.]

5,17,2,4,"get in there man! flirt back, mix it up!",
5,17,2,6,"wow! she is pretty, huh?",[joining him]
5,17,4,1,what happened?,
5,17,4,3,"no joey, i think he's just watchin' tv.",[it's only when the camera cuts to ross's apartment that we see that the tv is turned off and ross is indeed doing a bit. he then tries to hide his smirk.]
5,17,5,10,what?,
5,17,5,12,"wow! for just a week you guys are really close, huh?",
5,17,5,14,i know it is the best.,
5,17,5,16,what? it's still going on.,
5,17,5,18,"i-i am serious, i mean, we're, we're all over each other all the time.",
5,17,5,20,what don't you just calm down phoebe! all right?! why don’t you just get all your facts before you run around telling everybody that you're the only hot couple!!,[start annoying hyper-competitive mode now.] [jumping up]
5,17,5,22,"oh no, it is okay, i mean as long as you know that chandler and i are also very hot and fiery, just as hot as you! i mean our flame, whew, is on fire!",
5,17,5,24,you are so cute.,[she goes over and kisses him passionately.]
5,17,6,12,"hey rach, a guy from ralph lauren called, you got a second interview!",[entering from the bathroom]
5,17,6,14,yes!,
5,17,6,18,a kiss? what are you talking about?,
5,17,6,22,he probably wants you back because you're right for the job.,
5,17,10,4,"phoebe, do you want to go see a movie after dinner tonight?",
5,17,10,6,what are you doing?,
5,17,10,8,"oh, we're not seeing a movie!","[that annoying competitiveness thing kicks in again, what the heck is that with her and why must the writers show it every flippin' episode?!]"
5,17,10,10,"oh umm, that's because i just wanted to y'know walk in on me and chandler while we were, y'know, doing it all night. will you excuse me for just a second?",
5,17,10,12,okay. chandler? can i see you for a second?,[she gets up and walks over to chandler.]
5,17,10,14,okay. we have got to beat them! {here we go yet again.},[they walk away to get some privacy.]
5,17,10,16,"'cause, gary and phoebe think they're a hotter couple than we are!",
5,17,10,18,so! so we've got to go upstairs and have a lot of sex to prove them wrong!,
5,17,12,1,phoebe and gary are so gonna hear about this at dinner.,
5,17,12,3,we are the hottest! huh? no one is hotter than we are! you're the best.,
5,17,12,5,"no, you're the best.",
5,17,12,7,i am the best.,"[just as they start to get up, joey walks in.]"
5,17,12,9,hey joey! isn't that the girl that waved at you the other day?,[looking out the window]
5,17,12,11,why?,
5,17,12,13,"what are you talking about? she obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!",[pointing out the window.]
5,17,12,15,"no, those first two windows, that's the lobby. and y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway. you've been counting wrong.",[points]
5,17,15,1,"you better believe he's tired, after the day we had! if you know what i mean. you know what i mean?",
5,17,15,5,"phoebe, you have a, a twig in your hair.",
5,17,15,8,you didn't!,
5,17,15,10,the park huh? a public place.,
5,17,15,12,i hear ya. excuse me for just a second!,[gets up and heads for the bathroom as that annoying gotta-win-at-all-costs-super-competitive thing kicks in again.] [cut to the men's room. chandler is practicing flashing his badge as monica enters.]
5,17,15,13,hi chandler.,
5,17,15,15,yes it is. you see i've always found the men's bathroom very sexual. haven't you?,
5,17,15,17,"come on, we can't let them win!",
5,17,15,19,because phoebe and gary are in that-can't-keep-their-hands-off-each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase!,
5,17,15,21,i feel really sad that we're not…really there anymore.,
5,17,15,23,wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other all the time?,
5,17,15,25,really?,
5,17,15,27,"that is so sweet. i know that i was acting a little crazy but umm, i feel the same way.",

5,17,15,33,"okay, i freaked out a little.",
5,17,16,1,thank god! i can't watch him anymore!,
5,18,2,5,"besides, if anybody's gonna get free stuff, it's gonna be me.",
5,18,2,11,"i think it's a great idea. yeah, we could have a dinner party and just invite her close friends.",
5,18,2,16,i would love to do it together!,[joey starts to giggle.]
5,18,2,21,it's gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be ben's dad.,
5,18,5,1,that doesn't seem fair.,
5,18,5,5,"rachel, you can go down there, you don't have to smoke. just say you wanna get some fresh air.",
5,18,5,9,hey!,
5,18,5,16,"yeah, me too!",[runs and grabs her 3-ring binder of ideas.]
5,18,5,18,"all right, that's a little sketch of the cake, umm some sample menus, umm y'know what i thought we would start out with tuscan style finger food, and for music, here's an alphabetized list of all my cds! i've highlighted the ones that would go really good with the food.",
5,18,5,20,"oh, we're not doing that. okay…",
5,18,5,22,"what?! i didn't take care of everything, there's-there's plenty of things for you to do!",

5,18,9,4,"no, i'm-i'm serious!",
5,18,9,11,that's so gross!,
5,18,9,14,"chandler! i have to tell you, you smell so smokey i have to get up. i'm not kidding.",[she's not; she stands and walks away. chandler moves closer.]
5,18,13,2,why don't you just go out with her!,[overhearing that] [chandler starts to follow her into the kitchen.]
5,18,13,5,chandler! everyone--no one's eating my tuscan finger food 'cause they're all filling up on phoebe's snow cones!,
5,18,13,7,y'know…go! go! right there!,[points]

5,19,2,31,"so umm, when i was in the shower i was thinking about our first night in london…",

5,19,2,43,great!,
5,19,2,62,rach? what are you doing?,[noticing rachel crawling behind the couch]
5,19,2,64,it's a diaper commercial.,
5,19,2,83,what's goin' on?,
5,19,2,86,"it's okay. i don't care. it's uh, it's fine.",
5,19,2,89,"it's no big deal, i do it all the time.",
5,19,2,91,sure! it doesn't mean anything! just like i know it doesn't mean anything with you!,
5,19,2,94,"chandler, this actually bothers you?",
5,19,2,107,what?,
5,19,3,12,"phoebe! i have to have those earrings, we're going to leave as soon as the show is over.",[following her]
5,19,3,14,no you didn't.,
5,19,3,27,"yeah, it's good.",
5,19,3,29,"chandler! okay, let me get this straight, it's okay for you to flirt, but not for me.","[joey and his grandmother shush them and wave them away, which they do.]"
5,19,3,31,"go on, teach me something about men and women.",
5,19,3,33,no way!,
5,19,3,35,well that's pathetic!,
5,19,3,37,and this goes for all guys?,
5,19,3,42,no! you are not gonna run out and leave her here!,
5,19,3,51,phoebe!,[entering from her room] [motions for the earrings. phoebe gives her the one-minute sign.]

5,19,3,61,"wow! all right well, i mean, what can you do? if you lost it you lost it.",[shocked]
5,19,3,63,"all right, sweetie that's fine. you didn't do it on purpose.",
5,19,3,65,look at you! come here! feel better?,[they hug.]
5,19,3,68,"that is exactly why i do not lend you stuff!! okay?! i mean, first it's my jewelry! and if it's not my jewelry, it's-it's my blue sweater! and if it's not my sweater, it's my sunglasses!",[angrily] [rachel looks over at phoebe in resignation.]
5,19,3,70,yes!,
5,19,6,0,what about these? these look the same?,
5,19,6,2,not as each other!,
5,19,6,5,hi!,
5,19,6,7,yeah.,
5,19,6,9,"ohh, you're about to get a little luckier.",
5,19,6,11,"oh, honey, the earrings…",
5,19,6,13,my boyfriend really does have good taste!,[he turns to get his coat and monica gives rachel and phoebe two thumbs up as chandler walks over to ross.]
5,20,1,0,"okay, guys, listen, don't forget that tomorrow is the day that emily gets married again, so whatever we do, just try to really keep ross's mind off of it.",
5,20,1,11,hey!,
5,20,2,1,"hey! oh, i'm so glad you're home, i thought tonight we could finally organize these photos!",
5,20,2,3,"okay, i've broken them down into categories. okay, we have uh, we got holidays, birthdays, candids, y'know… and then what i've done is i've cross-referenced them by subject. right? so if you're looking up, oh let's say birthdays and dogs, you get photo 152. see?",[hands her the photo.]
5,20,2,5,"you can also find him under umm, dog and dead.",
5,20,2,7,"all right, hand me that other box of photos; that's the very last one.",
5,20,2,10,i hadn't! photo 152 was a prototype.,
5,20,2,14,"all right, he's keys are in the drawer. y'know what? i also need some cash.",
5,20,2,16,"nah, while you're at ross's if you see any lying around…",
5,20,2,18,"what?! i-i-i don't, i don't do that!",[rachel slowly leaves the apartment.]
5,20,4,1,rach! it's me! pick up!,[on the answering machine] [rachel runs over and answers the phone with the blender in hand.]
5,20,4,3,"i need a few more things to make the margaritas. uhh, i need some salt, some margarita mix, and tequila.",
5,20,4,5,see if he has ice.,
5,20,6,1,nooo!,[does rachel's]
5,20,6,3,"well thank god you were here! i mean, we have to erase that!",
5,20,6,5,"we have too! i mean what if ross's hears that and then calls her back and then they get back together? is that what you want? ross back with that controlling, neurotic, crazy emily? the emily that wouldn't let him see you?",
5,20,6,7,"i'm his sister, okay? i love him! i don't want to see him get hurt! come on! doesn’t that give me the right to control him—help him?",
5,20,6,9,"no, look, she's obviously unstable, okay? i mean she's thinking about running out on her wedding day. okay, fine! but i mean, look at the position she's putting him in! what's he gonna do? ross is gonna run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?! i mean, who would do that?! okay, fine, all right, but that's y'know, it's different! although it did involve a lot of the same people.",[rachel slowly turns and glares at her.] [realizing what she just said.] [rachel again turns and glares at her in disgust.]
5,20,6,11,"y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to play on him.",
5,20,8,0,"all right, i guess we should go.",
5,20,8,2,oh yeah right!,[she grabs the money and shoves into her pocket.]
5,20,8,4,there's nothing we can do. you erased the message!,
5,20,8,6,"well, if you're gonna be totally rational about this, i can't argue with you! all right? fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. i just don't want to be a part of it.",[the phone rings.]
5,20,8,9,wow! play that message for emily and this whole problem goes away!,
5,20,12,3,"man, i would be great in a war! i mean, i really, i think i would make a fantastic military leader. i mean i know i would make general way before any of you guys.",
5,21,1,3,no. i think we learned that from the sugarlips incident. i'm gonna get some tea.,
5,21,1,7,"so it looks like it's going really well for you two, huh?",
5,21,1,9,oh my god!,[shocked]
5,21,1,11,i think that is so great! when are you gonna ask her?,
5,21,1,13,"i swear, i promise. i promise. oh my god, i'm so excited! { and i just can't hide it ! i'm about to lose control and i think i like it ! sorry, just couldn't resist it.} all right, listen let me tell you, do not get her flowers. okay? because y'know, she cries when they die, and there's the whole funeral…",
5,21,1,17,gary's gonna ask you to move in with him!!,[sitting down]
5,21,1,19,"he just told me at the counter. he made me promise not to tell, but i couldn't hold it in any longer!",

5,21,4,22,"you have scratches all over you, what happened?",[rachel's arms are covered with scratches.]

5,21,6,6,he's a dropper!,
5,21,6,14,oh my—oh good god!,
5,21,6,17,"so, why don't you just take it back to where you got it?",
5,21,6,20,"rach, why won't they take it back?",
5,21,6,22,"look, if you want you can keep it at our place until you find out what to do with it.",
5,21,6,24,"oh my god, the cat's made my eyes water! don't-don't throw it to me! my vision's been compromised!! oh god! okay. okay. it's okay. man, that was close.",[quickly grabs a tissue to wipe her eyes.]
5,21,6,37,so you're moving in with him. what happened?,
5,21,6,39,"why, do you write him a lot?",
5,21,9,1,come on guys! suck it up! we're closing in on ten hours! it's gut-check time!,
5,21,9,3,please! i made this game what it is.,
5,21,9,6,"all right, there's some pizza at my place, we can all eat with one hand right? are you with me?",
5,21,9,8,"all right! let's go! let's go team monica! all right, we can work out the name later.",[runs to the door.] [the guys all stop and stare at her] [cut to her apartment where rachel is sitting at the table.]

5,21,9,14,wow! you made a profit!,
5,21,11,0,"all right! come on monica! look alive! come on, look alive!",
5,21,11,13,"it's okay. it's okay. just pretend that it didn't happen! okay? no one needs to know! i mean, phoebe's not an official ballplayer! i mean, only official ballplayers can drop the ball!",
5,21,11,17,"okay! okay, let's race! first one there wins! ha-ha!",[runs out the door and everyone watches her leave.] [pause]
5,22,1,3,wow! it's really red! you should go see my eye doctor.,[to rachel]
5,22,1,6,"since we've been going out, i think i've mentioned his name twice!",

5,22,4,1,oh that's an eye removal machine.,[looks at it more closely]
5,22,4,3,i'm kidding! i'm kidding!,[rachel heads for the door but is intercepted by the doctor.]

5,22,5,1,they're still in my coat.,
5,22,5,7,"i love you. {there's another continuity error here. before monica says i love you, chandler's holding the vests so that you couldn't see the collar, you could see all three, and they were folding nicely. after she says the line and the camera cuts back to chandler, you can only see two out of the three, you can see the collar of the top one, and it looks like it was folded sloppily, unlike before. hey, you notice things while spending this much time on this!}",
5,22,5,25,i wanna say good-bye at the car!,
5,22,7,4,"oh, i know! umm, is it because he's always correcting people's grammar? whom! whom! sometimes it's who!",

5,22,8,17,"yes! all right, y'know what? why don't we start with a practice run? okay?",
5,22,8,19,no drops!,
5,22,8,21,okay.,
5,22,8,23,"on three, 1…2…3! now my pillow's all wet!",[rachel turns her head on three to avoid the drops.] [she was trying to fool rachel and squeezed the eyedropper.]

5,22,8,27,"all right, come here!",[she gets up and drags rachel off of the couch by her legs.]
5,22,8,29,i am going… i'm going--turn it over! i'm… i am going to get these drops in your eyes.,[rachel rolled onto her stomach and monica rolls her back.] [she is holding rachel down with both hands and has the eyedropper in her mouth.]
5,22,8,32,damn! it's empty!,[spitting out the eyedropper]
5,22,9,1,hello? it's joey. i'm so glad you called! chandler told me what happened. y'know he's really upset about it.,[answers the phone] [listens.] [to phoebe] [phoebe's proud of herself.] [to joey]

5,22,9,5,"yeah, she's here. hold on a second.",[she hands the phone to phoebe.]

5,22,11,0,hello?,[answering it]
5,22,11,2,"hey joey! aww, you remembered even though you're a big star!",
5,22,11,4,"joey, what's it like on a movie set, huh? do you have a dressing room? do you have a chair with your name on it?",
5,22,12,2,go!!,[phoebe jumps to the floor as ross tackles rachel off of the couch. chandler helps push rachel onto the floor by jumping over the back of the couch. phoebe grabs rachel's head to hold it still and opens rachel's eye as monica jumps onto chandler's back to administer the torture--i mean medicine.]
5,22,12,4,okay! okay! okay! we'll see you in about 3 to 4 hours.,[she succeeds in getting the eye drops in and everyone climbs off of rachel.]

5,23,2,9,"it was, it was really nice. we started talking and i-i ended up having lunch with him.",
5,23,2,11,really?,
5,23,2,13,"the strange part was, he was really nice, umm and he looks great, but i didn't feel anything at all!",
5,23,2,15,because it would totally freak him out and tomorrow's our anniversary. i just don't want anything to spoil that.,

5,23,2,22,it's almost our anniversary!,

6,9,1,12,"well, um, because mainly, um, they don’t like you. i’m sorry.",
6,9,1,14,"maybe because you used to be aloof, or that you’re really sarcastic, or that, y’know, you joke around all the time. or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch.",

8,9,1,28,all right fine! if it means that much to you! but just—there’s gonna be a ton left over.,
8,9,1,30,"all right, you’re telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting?",

8,20,9,35,"okay! i will! mrs. green? mrs. green! it is rude to leave a party without saying good-bye to the host! yeah, and-and also when someone apologizes to you the decent thing to do is to accept it! now what i did to you, it wasn’t on purpose! but what you’re during to me now is just plain spiteful!",[she ignores monica and monica follows her out into the hall with phoebe in tow.]
8,20,9,37,that’s right! maybe it’s time you took a good hard look at a mirror young lady…old lady…lady!,

9,22,13,58,"oh my god, we're gonna be parents!",[excitedly]
9,22,13,60,"and it could be soon. i mean, think about it right now, somewhere out there our baby could be being conceived.",[they go look through the window]

9,23,3,15,"i guess, in time.",
9,23,3,17,"i mean, my feelings for richard are certainly gone.",
9,23,6,0,wow! that mike thing was interesting! i don't know what's gonna happen with phoebe and david.,
9,23,6,2,"ok, i'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee.",
9,23,6,4,what? why?,[looks very shocked]
9,23,6,6,"chandler, we have talked about this. you are not supposed to give people advice! now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke?",
9,23,6,8,"they've only been going out for a few weeks and phoebe is completely hung up on mike! she'll say ""no"", david's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then phoebe will end up alone again",
9,23,7,4,"ok! when i go places with high humidity, it gets a little extra body, ok?!",
9,23,7,7,"oh, honey, can you make sure we get a king size bed!",[to chandler]
9,23,7,9,and make sure our room isn't next to theirs .,[shouts to chandler] [points to phoebe]

9,23,7,25,i need to talk to you.,[looking very serious]
9,23,7,27,"ok, my husband just gave your boyfriend some very bad advice. look, david is going to propose to you tonight.",
9,23,7,29,what are you serious? you wanna marry him? wha... what about mike?,
9,23,7,31,do you really think marrying someone else is the right answer?,
9,23,10,1,"ok, mike, enough is enough, now you love phoebe and she loves you, so you need to get over your whole ""i never want to get married"" thing and step up!",
9,23,10,3,"this is monica! i'm phoebe's friend. listen, phoebe is back with david and he's going to propose to her, and she is going to say ""yes"" but i know she really wants to be with you!",
9,23,10,5,"i... i'm sorry, did you say something? i can't hear through all this damned hair!","[tries to move her huge hair away from the phone, in vain]"
9,23,10,7,"you don't tell me what to do! i tell you what to do! just call her. she's at the paradise hotel in barbados. and while i've got you, you've got curly hair. what do you do in humidity? damnit!",[mike hangs up the phone] [chandler walks in]
9,23,10,8,"well, i hope you're happy!",[sarcastically]
9,23,10,10,"phoebe is going to say ""yes"" to david. see, that's what happens when you meddle in people's lives!",
9,23,10,12,"no it's not, b'cause she's still in love with mike!",
9,23,10,14,"no, i called him. it's not gonna happen.",
9,23,10,16,"well, if you hadn't meddled to start with, i wouldn't have had to go in there and meddle myself. now, no matter how much we meddle, we will never be able to un-meddle the thing that you meddled up - in the first place!",
9,23,14,0,i can't believe she's gonna say yes to david. she's clearly in love with mike.,
9,23,14,3,"oh my god, he's gonna do it now. please, i cannot watch this, let's go.",
9,23,14,13,it's the humidity!,
9,23,14,26,"you're the most incredible woman i've ever met. how can i lose you? now, i don't actually have a ring...",[phoebe looks very flattered]
9,23,14,41,because of our meddling! alright?,[to everybody]

9,23,18,4,"ping pong? honey, they have ping pong! let's play!",[pleasantly surprised] [to chandler]
9,23,18,6,why not?,[disappointed]

9,23,18,10,i punched you...?,[hesitatingly]
9,23,18,12,... phoebe...?,
9,23,18,14,i clunked your heads together!,"[chandler turns to mike and gives him a ""see what i mean?"" look]"
9,23,20,0,"c'mon guys, it'll be fun!",
9,23,20,2,but then how do we know who wins?,
9,23,20,4,"so, we're just four losers... super!",
9,23,20,8,ok!,[smiling]
9,23,20,12,sure! got to!,[monica and mike start to play ping pong. mike scores]
9,23,20,13,aww!,
9,23,20,17,"hell, yeah!",

9,23,20,23,make it fifty!,
9,23,20,25,one thousand...,[nearly shouting]
9,23,20,28,no... either of you girls got a quarter?,[going through her pockets] [to chandler and phoebe]
9,23,20,31,"heads! no, tails! he-he-heads!",
9,23,20,33,"ow, what are the chances!",[angry] [they start playing again]
9,23,20,34,ha! my point!,

9,23,23,6,ah yeaaaah!,
9,23,23,11,"oh, damn it!",
9,23,23,14,"don't get too cocky! remember i won the last one! oh, by the way, how did that feel, losing to a girl?",[threatening]
9,23,23,16,"no, no, nooo!",
9,23,23,19,best out of three?,
9,23,23,22,"serve the ball, chump!",[to mike]
9,23,25,2,"no, i have just to have two more points to beat him!",
9,23,25,4,i can't just walk away! i've put in four hours!,
9,23,25,6,"look! you knew this about me when you married me! you agreed to take me in sickness and in health. well, this is my sickness!",
9,23,25,8,that's just good sense!,[they start playing again; suddenly monica hits the table with her hand]
9,23,25,9,aww!,"[in pain] [she holds her hand, moaning like she's biting back a scream]"
9,23,25,11,"no, no, no. honey, i'm ok. shake it off! oh, no! no shaking, no shaking! ooh! ooh! oh my god! i can't play!",[she shakes the wrist and it's more painful] [pause]

10,1,1,12,"wait a minute, i think phoebe's right. you know i hear someone else in there with him.",[they all put their ear against the wall to be able to hear what's being said. we move to ross's room where he and charlie are kissing.]
10,1,1,15,"oh my god, that's charlie!",
10,1,1,18,i'm not sure about this.,
10,1,1,20,no i'm not sure that it's the best way to hear everything. someone get me a glass!,

10,4,3,101,what are you barking at?,"[to the dog] [while phoebe's bear is still in the lead, it is now closely followed by joey's robot. chandler and monica's dog however, sits down, barking... and does a backflip.]"
10,4,3,102,wha... how the hell is that gonna help?,
10,4,3,108,"no! no, no... wait! we didn't lose. the rules clearly stated that the last one to cross the finish line was the loser. well, our dog never crossed the finish line, so technically...",[turns to chandler]

10,9,9,9,"c'mon chandler, i think we have been given an opportunity. i mean, the mistake has already been made. they are writing up the paper right now.",
10,9,9,11,because... we may not be who she thinks we are but no-one will ever love that baby more than us.,[very emotional]
