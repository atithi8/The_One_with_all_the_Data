4,6,2,7,"oh, the velveteen rabbit ! oh my god, when the boy's love makes the rabbit real!",

4,6,8,1,any luck?,
4,6,8,3,"all right, look. why don't you just return the book, let joey give her the clock pen, and you give her something worse than that. like... a regular pen.",
4,6,8,5,"aw, honey, that's so sweet.",

4,7,11,2,"phoebe, his music could not get any worse. there are rats in the basement that are hanging themselves.","[ross finally finishes with the same crash, and gets some applause.]"
4,7,11,6,what?,
4,8,2,2,so are things with you and joey any better?,
4,8,2,4,"oh wow, eight hours? so you could probably really use one of those plug-in telephone headsets huh?",
4,8,2,6,you shouldn’t.,
4,8,2,9,"well, i’m gonna take a nap, turkey makes me sleepy.",
4,8,2,11,"i know, but all that work you’re doing to get it ready, i just…",[goes into her bedroom.]

4,9,8,8,do you want me to quit?,
4,9,8,10,"well of those things that you said in the interview, i mean if you believe any of them, i must not be a very good assistant. y’know what? i am just gonna pack up my desk, and i will be gone by the end of the day! well, i guess there’s no use to me sticking around ‘til the end of the day!","[she goes over to get all of her belongings from the desk, which amount to a muffin and a pen] [realizes she has nothing.] [starts to leave.]"

5,13,3,2,"okay, it's missing something. ooh, i know! umm, okay.","[goes and grabs a bag, that looks like a purse, and shows it to joey.]"

5,13,5,7,"joey, y'know you get any mustard on that bag, you can't return it.",
5,13,5,9,"all right, then you owe me $350.",
5,13,5,11,joey…,[glaring at him]

5,14,1,1,i'd say from the looks of it; our naked buddy is moving.,
5,14,1,3,"ohh, i'm gonna miss that big old squishy butt.",

5,14,7,1,"oh ross, honey you gotta stop torturing yourself!",
5,14,7,4,y'know what you should do?,
5,14,7,6,"you should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond with him. yeah! like if i would strike up a conversation about say umm, sandwiches. or uh, or my underwear.",

5,14,7,26,are you kidding?!,
5,14,7,28,"i can not believe he would do that to mon—whoa! joey, do they know that we know?",[she stops suddenly and slowly turns to point at joey. joey is avoiding her eyes.]

5,14,10,15,"yeah, oh wait!",[she goes for another one.]
5,14,10,40,"joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner phoebe breaks chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.",
5,14,10,42,okay!,
5,15,1,6,"hey, what's-what's going on?!",[running from the guy's apartment with joey in tow]
5,15,1,13,"awww, no, it's okay, we've actually known for a while.",[there's another pause as ross gets angry again.]
5,15,1,15,"well, ross, we were worried about you. we didn't know how you were going to react.",[pause.]
5,15,2,7,"oh! oh, i just thought of the greatest wedding gift to get you.",
5,15,2,9,okay.,[a girl enters.]
5,15,2,19,she is so cute! you could fit her right in your little pocket!,
5,15,2,27,"aww, joey, come here. look honey, i know this must be really, really difficult for you and i--oh, i'm sorry. am i hurting you?",[she takes his hand.]
5,15,4,2,"hmm. look, ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don't you just pay the hundred bucks? the party's gonna cost you way more than that.",
5,15,4,4,"okay, i thought it was about your neighbors liking you.",
5,15,4,6,and that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.,
5,15,4,8,"umm, chandler, you do realize that those ideas are probably already in monica's head.",
5,15,4,10,"well, because she loves you and because you love her.",
5,15,4,12,"hey, chandler, don't freak out! i'm telling you something you already know! come on, she broke up with richard because he didn't want to have babies. and she's a woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know it's monica.",
5,15,4,14,"no, you're right, you are absolutely right. i mean that makes, that makes everything different.",
5,15,4,16,not unless different means the same.,
5,15,9,1,"hi! wow! you look, you look…big.",
5,15,9,3,"uhhh, yeah. but it's not obvious why.",
5,15,9,7,"hey! hey, cute jacket!",

5,15,12,11,"ohhhh, i cannot look at it!",[she doesn't move.]
5,15,13,5,"oh no wait pheebs, i think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you. but i'm not sure, chandler?",
5,16,3,0,"uhh, we still need a tip.",[looking at the bill]
5,16,3,2,a couple of bucks.,
5,16,3,6,"phoebe, i bet somebody's missing that badge.",
5,16,3,10,hey joey!,
5,16,4,0,ugh!,[disgusted at ross's antics]
5,16,4,2,what?! you say that to kids?!!,
5,16,4,4,"ross, honey, it's a nice couch. it's not a magic couch.",
5,16,4,9,"wait! no, that's ridiculous. come on, he lives three blocks away!",
5,16,4,11,yeah! are you kiddin'?,[she puts on her coat and turns around and sees ross is expecting her to help.] [laughing.]
5,16,4,13,oh. oh! i can do it!,"[disgustedly she goes and tries to pick up the couch. much to her amazement, she is successful.]"
5,16,4,18,ross!,
5,16,4,20,ross!,
5,16,4,25,"come on, i don't really want to be doing this right now. i am carrying a very heavy couch.",
5,16,4,27,fine! we went out.,[to ross] [to the salesman]
5,16,4,29,ross!! oh my--ugh!! you kept count?! you are such a loser!,
5,16,6,1,"ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here?",
5,16,6,4,"okay, y'know what? there is no more left, left!",
5,16,6,6,yeah.,
5,16,6,8,oh-oh!,[she can't stay at the end as the couch rounds the turn so she shifts to the back corner of the couch and is at a 90-degree angle to it.]
5,16,6,10,any chance you think the couch looks good there?,
5,16,7,38,"hey, umm, do you guys have that tape measure?",[entering]
5,16,7,41,what's up joey?,[noticing him]
5,16,9,0,"hey! joey, would you mind giving me and ross a hand moving his couch?",
5,16,9,2,thanks!,

5,16,9,6,what's up joe?,
5,16,9,8,yeah?,
5,16,9,10,what are you saying?,[laughing]
5,16,9,12,"y'know honey, umm, as uh, as flattered as i am that uh, you saw me first, uhh, i just, i-i don't think we should be cranking anything up.",
5,16,9,14,"yeah, well, y'know umm… no honey, listen i think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them, but i think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone, become their friend, build a foundation, then you ask them out on a date. don't hit on your existing friends!",[laughs and pushes the chair back in]
5,16,9,16,"yeah. yeah. oh, but once you find it, ohh it's so worth the wait.",
5,16,10,1,hey ross! i brought reinforcements.,[entering]
5,16,10,3,"well, i brought the next best thing.",
5,16,10,8,"whoa-oh, what's-what's that?",[points.]
5,16,10,10,wow! you certainly think a lot of yourself.,
5,16,10,14,okay!,
5,16,10,24,"ross, i don't, i just don't think it's going to fit.",
5,16,10,28,you think?!,
5,16,10,32,"i know, me neither! i mean, you had a sketch!",
5,16,11,1,hey! how's it going? did you make any new friends?,
5,16,11,7,what?! why?!,
5,16,12,9,"oh my god, phoebe, are you gonna go to jail?!",
5,17,1,0,"good, you guys are all here!",
5,17,1,2,"well, i have a job interview at ralph lauren tomorrow!",
5,17,1,4,i know!,
5,17,1,6,wh-what?!,
5,17,1,8,"anyway, i'm going to be the coordinator of the woman's collection, i'll work right under the director, it's the perfect, perfect job for me!",
5,17,1,10,yeah.,
5,17,1,12,o-okay!,
5,17,1,14,hi.,[they shake hands.]
5,17,6,1,"ugh, horrible! i did the stupidest, most embarrassing thing!",
5,17,6,3,no!,
5,17,6,5,"ugh, it was horrible! and-and the interview part went so well, y'know? i even made him laugh. he said something about a boat and i was like, ""well, yeah! if you've got enough life jackets!"" trust me, it was actually, it was very funny. anyway, so we were saying good-bye and ugh!",[she starts laughing; chandler and joey are not amused.]
5,17,6,7,"all right, we were shaking hands and he kinda leaned toward me… y'know maybe he was going to open the door, but i totally miss read him and i uhhh…",[we see a flashback as rachel describes what happened.] [the flashback shows that she kissed him on the cheek.]
5,17,6,9,"well, i didn't know what else to do!",
5,17,6,11,thanks chandler.,
5,17,6,13,i can't believe it! i got a second interview!,
5,17,6,16,"what-what, wait a minute, you don't think that's why he wants me back?",
5,17,6,19,"i accidentally kissed him in the interview, and now he wants me back y'know of course, 'cause ""let's bring the girl back who kisses everybody!""",
5,17,6,21,oh my god! what if he thinks i'm the kind of girl that-that would just sleep with him?,
5,17,6,23,"maybe. i-i don't know—oh god, how could i be so stupid?!",
5,17,6,25,"ohh, well i'm not totally back yet, but thank you.",
5,17,8,1,hi!,
5,17,8,4,thank you.,
5,17,8,6,what?,
5,17,8,8,excuse me?,
5,17,8,10,"wh-whoa! all right, okay-okay, i see, i see what's going on here! now listen, look-look, i'm sorry if i gave you the wrong impression, but i am not some hussy who will just sleep around to get ahead! now even though i , hey-hey-hey, even though i kissed you, that does not give you the right to demand sex from me. i do not want, this job that bad. good day, sir.",[stopping him] [he tries to interrupt and tell her about the ink] [she storms out of his office.]
5,17,9,0,"ugh, you will not believe what that sleaze-ball from ralph lauren did too me!","[entering] [joey, monica, and ross all point to their lips to get rachel to once again notice the ink on her lip.]"
5,17,9,1,okay-okay that-that's amazing. how did you know that?,
5,17,9,3,oh. ohhhhhhhhh….,[realizes.]
5,17,14,0,"ah, first, i-i would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again.",
5,17,14,2,"okay. umm, well, first i would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh, for yelling at you.",[looks around for the camera]
5,17,14,4,"now you're probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah, who did, who did not umm, yell at you and storm out, and i think that's a big mistake and here's why. i made a huge fool of myself and i came back, that shows courage. when i thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job, i said no. that shows integrity. and, i was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage. okay umm, now i know i already said courage, but y'know you gotta have courage. and umm, and finally when i thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace, i said no and i was not litigious. {by the way, litigious means to want to litigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against. so she didn't want to sue him. don't worry, i had to look it up too.} so there you go, you got, you got courage, you got integrity, you got courage again, and not litigious. look mr…",[she puts her hands on his desk blotter and he moves it. rachel then doesn't know where to put her hands.] [suddenly realizes that she said courage twice.] [counts them off with her fingers] [pause]
5,17,14,6,"zelner! right! i knew that! i really, really want this job and i think, i think i would be really good at it.",
5,17,14,8,oh! you are?,[gasps]
5,17,14,10,"really? oh thank you! oh… oh, would it be completely inappropriate to give you a hug?",
5,17,14,12,"okay, well then how about a handshake? oh god i'm sorry! oh god, i'm sorry! i did not mean to touch that—i mean you there. there. uhh, okay, so thank-thank you, i'm going to leave now thank you very much uh-huh, thank you so—hey! i'll see you monday!",[she goes to shake his hand but misses and touches his groin.] [exits.]
5,17,16,0,i cannot believe ross is buying this!,[laughs]
5,17,16,3,"yeah! oh by the way, thank you for loaning us pamela and yasmine.",[we see through the big window from the outside and see that monica and rachel have pictures of their faces pasted onto cardboard cutouts of pamela anderson and yasmine bleeth wearing their baywatch swimsuits.]
5,18,2,0,"okay, gotta go! wish me luck!",[entering from her room]
5,18,2,3,"uh well, y'know what? i don't think if i feel comfortable stealing on my very first day…",
5,18,2,6,"okay guys, way to wish me luck!",
5,18,4,1,"well umm, that one is pretty but uh, i just, i just love this fabric sorry.",[on the other one.]
5,18,4,4,"oh, what a fun office.",[laughing nervously]
5,18,4,7,"oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror stories… …about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke.",[stops and tries to change directions]
5,18,5,0,…and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the decisions without me!,
5,18,5,2,"i know! it's like i'm being punished for not having this disgusting, poisoning habit!",
5,18,5,4,"i mean what if this keeps happening? y'know, they'll-they'll be outside smoking, making all the decisions and i'll just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air, y'know? and then when the day comes when kim wants to promote one of us, who do you think she's gonna pick? me or smokey smokerson?",
5,18,5,6,"yeah, i can do that.",
5,18,5,11,i would love to!,
5,18,6,1,"oh well, it's kinda lonely up there, so i just thought i would come out here and get some fresh air.",
5,18,6,3,oh great!,
5,18,6,6,oh that's okay.,
5,18,6,10,"excuse me, can i, can i bum one of those? y'know what, actually… okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here?",[he holds up his pack.] [she takes the one he's smoking and heads over to where nancy and kim are standing and laughing.]
5,18,6,12,"oh, i thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know? y'know what i mean, like dubbies? and i actually, i thought to myself, ""wow, those guys are crazy!"" but no, i actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time.",
5,18,6,14,"oh, me too.",
5,18,6,16,"oh, me too.",[laughs]
5,18,9,1,"oh it was great! it was great! i went down there just like you said, y'know? and we talked business. kim totally took my opinions.",
5,18,9,3,thanks!,
5,18,9,5,well-well that's 'cause i went down there and they were all smoking. this is actually the smell of success.,
5,18,9,7,i did not!,
5,18,9,9,"all right, fine! but i had too! i had to do it for my career!",
5,18,9,12,"no well, no it's not that bad, y'know? i mean yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell, i actually feel like i can throw up.",
5,18,10,2,i am so on board!,[she throws away her recently lit cigarette.]
5,18,10,4,"yeah, i did, but y'know what? i am really, really trying to cut back, y'know? good luck, rach.",[laughs]
5,18,10,8,well then let's just quit! we'll just quit! let's all quit!,
5,18,10,11,oh but you could. you can. absolutely! we can help each other out! we can get--what are those--those patches! we could be like the patch sisters!,
5,18,10,13,yes! great! give me those cigs! give it! give it!,[she grabs their cigarettes and lighters and throws them in the trash.]
5,18,10,15,okay then!,[she starts rummaging through the trash to find kim's lighter.]
5,18,12,0,hey! hey-hey-hey!!,
5,18,12,2,come on you guys! what are doing?! i thought we were the patch sisters!,
5,18,12,5,"well y'know if you, if you started smoking again you could've at least told me! come on, give me one of those! what are we talking about?",
5,18,12,7,"oh wait, no-no-no! drag me down. drag-drag me down.",
5,18,12,9,okay.,[starts to walk away.]
5,18,12,11,oh man!,[hearing that]
5,18,13,11,what?! what?! my birthday's not for another month!,
5,18,13,13,oh my god! you guys this is so great! i mean it's so unexpected! i mean chandler's birthday is even before mine!,"[everyone stops and looks at chandler, who's nodding.]"
5,18,13,15,wow! this is great! look at all these cups! this is so weird.,
5,18,13,17,"oh, okay, not so weird.","[cut to another part of the room, ross is going to talk to joey.]"
5,19,2,0,"i am so proud of joey, i can't believe he's going to be on law & order !",
5,19,2,2,no because first they arrest the guy and then they try him.,
5,19,2,6,what's going on?,
5,19,2,13,ross! we broke up two years ago; you've been married since then. i think it's okay that we see other people.,
5,19,2,15,hm-mmm.,
5,19,2,17,"okay, y'know what? we don't need her measurements.",
5,19,2,22,big night!,
5,19,2,45,"oh, umm, okay, yeah, i'll be, yeah i'll be right back.","[goes to her room.] [phoebe then gets possessed 'cause she starts speaking in tongues. she speaks italian to joey's grandmother. she is quickly exorcised and returns to speaking in english. of course, too most people english is a strange language as well. but none of them are probably reading this and if they were they wouldn't understand it. so why am i talking about them? i have absolutely no clue. moving on…]"
5,19,2,48,here you go. thank you!,[she enters and hands phoebe the earring]
5,19,2,50,"oh what, you-you want both of them?",
5,19,2,52,"okay, okay, okay, look, just don't freak out, but i kinda lost it. i know it's in the apartment, but i definitely lost it.",
5,19,2,54,tell her to wear her own earrings.,
5,19,2,56,nooo! nooooo! you lent me monica's earrings?! i'm not allowed to borrow her stuff!,
5,19,2,58,because i lose her stuff!,"[time lapse, the gang is now watching law & order . by the way, the entire rest of the episode takes place in monica and rachel's apartment. why are they called apartments when they're all stuck together? something to think about.]"
5,19,2,63,"oh boy, i just can't watch. it's too scary!",
5,19,2,65,"oh yeah well, you know me, babies, responsibilities, ahhh!!!",[there's a knock on the door.]
5,19,2,96,"uhh, no, no, it bothered me when he slept with other women.",
5,19,2,98,"but y'know, i never really had anything to worry about. ross was never very good at the flirting thing.",
5,19,2,100,"oh! y'know what? you're right! we meet, you flirted and then bamn nine years later you had me!",
5,19,2,103,ohh! thank god! where was it?,
5,19,2,105,okay that is the one we already have!,
5,19,2,111,what?!,[smiling]
5,19,2,115,yeah.,[smiling]
5,19,3,4,"joey, why don't you just tell her what happened? it's not your fault.",[smiling]
5,19,3,16,"it's not here pheebs, it's not here. ohh, i went to joey and chandler's last night! okay!",[goes to the door.]
5,19,3,18,wait a minute. chandler has a jewelry box?,

5,20,4,2,hey! what's up?!,
5,20,4,4,so all we have is ice?,
5,20,4,6,okay.,"[she hangs up the phone and starts to head back to the kitchen and notices some money lying out, stops, reaches down to pick it up, the phone rings causing her to drop it, she quickly puts it back, and heads for the kitchen.]"

5,20,6,6,noo! oh no! no! god no! he should not get back together with her. i know that! you know that! even ross knows that! but that still doesn’t give us the right to erase his message!,

5,20,6,12,"okay, you are crazy! i'm sorry, but she sounded generally upset! i mean, listen!",[she hits a button on the machine.]

5,20,8,3,"no, monica! monica! we have to fix this!",
5,20,8,5,yeah well unless we tell him.,
5,20,8,7,"oh, maybe that's emily calling back to leave the exact same message.",
5,20,8,10,right?,
5,20,11,0,hey! hi!,
5,20,11,2,"hey! y'know what? you are in our apartment all the time! okay? this is, this is just a drop in the bucket mister!",

5,20,11,8,yeah!,
5,20,11,10,really?!,[gasps]
5,20,11,12,because a car backfired?,
5,20,11,14,"well, i-i-i don't know how this fits into your whole ""seizing"" thing but um, emily called you today.",
5,20,11,16,"no, she left a message. but it-it kinda got erased. there's just something wrong with your machine.",[he starts for the machine.] [stopping him.] [pause]
5,20,11,18,"well, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her.",
5,20,11,20,"now, that-that was a good thing that i told you, right?",
5,20,11,22,"okay. thank you! thank you! because—i'm sorry, all right. because y'know what? she didn't want me—not important. the point is, i was right. your decision. okay? i was right. your decision.",[she starts for the door.] [stops]
5,20,11,24,"okay, no, that's not the right decision. that's not, that's not right, no ross-ross, come on! i mean, that woman made you miserable! okay, ross, do you really want to get back into that?",
5,20,11,26,"ugh, ross! that was not a near death experience! that was barely an experience!",
5,20,11,28,"okay, y'know what? maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. maybe this is about escaping stuff.",
5,20,11,30,"i mean, look-look today you escaped death, y'know? and maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with emily?",[pause] [not believing it]
5,20,11,32,"well, there you go!",
5,20,11,34,close call day.,[laughing]
5,20,11,36,"ohh, honey no problem. okay.",[gets up.]

5,20,11,44,"yeah, uh you-you probably need that for stamps, right?",[going out the door] [ross is stunned.]
5,21,2,11,"hey, you guys…",[entering]
5,21,2,13,is monica here? joey and,
5,21,2,15,"all right listen umm, i just bought something i'm not sure she's gonna like it, and it's gonna seem a little crazy, but this is something that i wanted since i was a little girl.",
5,21,2,17,"noo! i wish! okay, you ready? joey and",
5,21,2,19,okay! check it out!,"[she goes and gets her surprise and when she returns with it, ross stares in shock.] [joey turns and looks at quite possibly one of the ugliest pets that you can possibly buy on the planet. rachel has bought herself a hairless cat. yep, a hairless cat! joey and ross start to get sick.]"
5,21,2,22,"it's a, it's a cat!",
5,21,2,24,yes it is!,
5,21,2,26,"excuse me! but this is a purebred, show-quality sphinx cat!",
5,21,2,28,"well, it was a little extravagant, but i a pretty good deal.",
5,21,2,30,a thousand bucks.,
5,21,2,33,"all right listen ball boys! my grandmother had one of these when i was a little girl and it was the sweetest thing! i mean it was so cute, it would sit in my lap and purr all day long, and i would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it!",
5,21,2,36,"ugh! look you guys, i'm really excited about this! okay? i don't care what you think! i'm gonna go set up a little litter box for mrs. whiskerson. well, what am i gonna call her? fluffy?!",[they both glare at her.] [rachel goes into the bathroom as the guys continue throwing the ball.]
5,21,4,17,hey.,
5,21,4,19,"oh, wow! congratulations, that's quite a waste of time.",
5,21,4,21,yeah?,
5,21,4,23,"well, it's my cat.",
5,21,4,25,"oh yeah, i got a cat.",
5,21,4,29,"you guys this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat. i mean, it's not sweet, it's not cute, i even dragged that little string on the ground, and it just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me. and i swear, i know this sounds crazy, but every time this cat hisses at me i know it's saying, ""rachel!""",
5,21,4,32,"well, i was gonna let you play with it.",
5,21,6,15,"i give up you guys, i don't know what i'm going to do with this thing!",[she's wearing an oven mitt to protect her hand]
5,21,6,18,i tried! they won't take her back.,
5,21,6,21,"well, they said would but they would only give me store credit. i mean, what am i going to do, get a thousand regular cats?",
5,21,6,23,"no mon that's not the point. i'm out a thousand dollars, i'm all scratched up, and i'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand!",[storms out.] [monica sneezes.]
5,21,8,0,show cat! quality show cat! show cat!,[a woman approaches.]
5,21,8,2,it's not a baby! it's a cat!,
5,21,8,4,"oh no! no! it's actually—it's very sweet. it's very sweet. look! yeah, do you want it?",[goes to pet it and it hisses at her.]
5,21,8,6,"well, so then what are you doing to me? okay? just get out of here! all right? move on!",[another woman approaches.]
5,21,8,8,yes! thank you! exactly! you want it?,
5,21,8,10,"oh, terrific! that'll be $2,000.",
5,21,8,12,"okay, a thousand.",
5,21,8,14,"well, i do, but you're just gonna have to actually look at this as more of an investment than a cat.",
5,21,8,16,"obviously you know how to haggle, so i'm not gonna try and take you on. okay? so $800 and i don't call the cops because you're robbing me blind! blind! just take cat, leave the money, and run away! run away! damnit! cat, can't you at least smile or something?! okay, did anybody just hear that? anybody?","[makes some unintelligible sound to stop her from leaving] [covers her eyes] [uncovers her eyes and sees that the woman has fled] [to the cat] [the cat hisses at her again, it sounds like rachel]"
5,21,9,10,"it's not! i'm defrosting a chicken. oh, i uh sold mrs. whiskerson.",[pause]
5,21,9,13,"yeah, 15 hundred dollars.",
5,21,9,16,"oh yeah, there you go.",[hands over the pillow.]

5,21,11,15,"phoebe, honey, wanna get some breakfast?",
5,21,12,1,"yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long.",
5,21,12,3,"no, i meant with the dropper over here.",[points at chandler.]
5,22,1,1,"well, my eye is a little itchy.",[ross turns to look at joey.]
5,22,1,4,richard? i'm not gonna go see your ex-boyfriend!,
5,22,1,9,"well, i'm sorry i'm not going to an eye doctor!",
5,22,1,13,"ross! come on! that's all right! fine--okay, i have a weird thing about my eye. can we not talk about it please?",[flinches]

5,22,4,28,okay. okay!,
5,22,4,30,"great!! it was very, very nice to meet you sir--ow! hey! what are you doing?! are you crazy!",[really excited] [he took out that thing they use to look at people's retinas and looked at rachel's when she was shaking his hand causing her to flinch and scream at him.]
5,22,4,32,"yeah, no, i don't-i don't put things in my eye.",
5,22,4,34,great!,
5,22,4,36,"okay, just give me the damn drops!",[grabs them and storms out.]

5,22,5,30,"well, wait a minute! the puss is good! it means it's healing!",[runs after him.]
5,22,7,6,"oh, did you beat him at a board game? he turns into such a baby when he starts to lose.",
5,22,7,8,eh! stop it!,
5,22,8,0,okay.,"[she tilts her head back and squeezes the eyedropper. the only problem is, it's not over her eye.]"

5,22,8,30,oh my god! you really are freakishly strong!,"[monica starts biting on the eyedropper, spraying the fluid all over. but rachel keeps turning her head back and forth and monica keeps missing.]"
5,22,8,31,monica! stop it!,
5,22,8,33,"wow, y'know if joey and chandler walked in right now, we could make a fortune!","[monica is straddling rachel and holding her arms down. in a rather risqué pose, at least for primetime tv.]"

5,23,10,1,"yeah, all right. all right! just keep walkin'! all right?",[ross keeps giggling and rachel decides upon revenge. she gets up and kisses the rather large man in the seat in front of ross on the back of his head. the guy turns around angrily.]

5,23,10,5,hi! the,"[to the flight attendant who appears in record time. it was only seconds after rachel pushed the call button was she there. once again, more proof that tv isn't real, irl she would've been waiting for the rest of the flight and by then ross's pants would be dry.]"
5,23,10,7,"yes, i'm sorry. do you have any extra pants? umm, my friend seems to have had a little accident.",
5,23,13,2,"yes, i did. thank you very much, it was excellent. the",[disembarks]

6,3,11,22,"but y’know what, if you think it’s gonna be okay we’ll just work out a system. y’know, it’ll be like college, i’ll hang a hanger on the door and put a sign, ""come back later, i’m gettin’ lucky.""",[laughs.]
6,3,13,3,"umm, well let’s see monica and chandler are occupied.",
6,3,13,5,"no, the other thing. i really think it’s great they work things out.",
6,3,13,7,"hey, can i borrow the key to your house so i can run across the street and make a copy?",

6,5,12,21,"yeah, don’t push it though.",
6,5,12,23,"i know. i always thought if you and i got married, it would be the one that stuck. and it wouldn’t be a secret, and we wouldn’t have our wedding dinner at pizza hut .",[they both laugh.]

6,8,2,21,"but, pheebs, you can still use the copy machine where i actually work. but, just come by at lunch so my boss doesn’t see you. cause kim will just freak out and she already doesn’t like me very much.",

6,8,5,0,"oh, kim, hi.",[kim doesn’t even look up from her report.]
6,8,5,2,"so you know, i…i handed in that marketing report and i never got to hear what you thought.",
6,8,5,4,"ahh….so…wow…the spring line, it’s really going to be great this year, huh?",
6,8,5,6,so i hear the ralph lauren fooled around with someone in the copy room.,[kim stops the elevator and turns to rachel.]
6,8,6,21,"yeah. your teeth? yes, i saw them from outside. you guys are never going to believe this. but, phoebe made out with ralph lauren.",[sitting down on the couch.]
6,8,6,24,"yeah i know. she ran into him at my office and they just…made out. and the craziest thing is, now my boss likes me because i told her about it and she said it was the best gossip she’d heard all year.",
6,8,6,31,"that-that is your make out buddy. don’t you recognize him? oh wait. ohh, phoebe i love you. kiss me please.",[holding up the magazine in front of her face.]
6,8,6,33,what?,
6,8,6,35,"oh my god, phoebe, that’s not ralph lauren. that’s kenny the copy guy.",
6,8,6,37,"oh..go..oh..and i told my boss that someone made out with ralph lauren. if she finds out that i lied to her, she is going to hate me even more. phoebe !!",
6,8,6,39,to get you to make out with him!!!,
6,8,11,0,"ohh, hi, kim.",
6,8,11,2,"yeah, remember that thing i told you that happened yesterday? well it didn’t happen.",
6,8,11,4,"okay, two things didn’t happen. remember i told you that someone made out with ralph lauren in the copy room? well, it turns out that’s not true.",
6,8,11,6,no.,
6,8,11,8,"oh no, no, no. oh god, you think i made out with him.",
6,8,11,10,i-i don’t want your job. i-i don’t. ohh this is such a mistake. i did not make out with him. nobody made out with him. i did not use my keycard yesterday. i don’t even know how to use my keycard.,[the elevator stops. ralph steps on.]
6,8,14,0,"now, she thinks that i made out with him and i did it to get her job.",
6,8,14,2,i did but she doesn’t think anyone would be stupid enough to confuse kenny the copy guy with ralph lauren.,
6,8,14,4,"you were with kenny today, weren’t you?",
6,8,14,6,"ohh, phoebe, what am i going to do?",
6,8,14,8,"i’m not going to sleep with ralph lauren. i mean, i could, but i wouldn’t.",
6,8,14,10,that wouldn’t help me.,
6,8,16,0,"kim, hi.",
6,8,16,2,okay..okay.. look. i’m sorry that i lied to you before. you were right. ralph and i were an item but were not anymore.,
6,8,16,4,"yeah, he dumped me. he said, ""rachel, i can’t do this. even though you are a very, very, very beautiful women. i can’t do this. i’m married and i’m sorry."" and then i don’t know why but he said, ""and you will never get promoted. especially not above kim, who is an integral cog in the ralph lauren machine.""",[faking crying.]
6,8,16,8,of course it’s true and it hurts so bad.,
6,8,16,10,you and ralph?,
6,9,3,2,"hey! hey, pheebs, check it out. yeah, for my desert, i have chosen to make a traditional english truffle!",
6,9,3,5,nothing?,[worried]
6,9,3,7,"so, if-if i mess this up, there’s nothing else for dessert?",
6,9,3,9,"wow, monica, i love that, you really have faith in me. thank you. technical question, how do you know when uh, the butter’s done?",
6,9,3,26,her dancer friends?,
6,9,3,46,really?!,
6,9,3,48,"i dunno. y’know to me he’ll always be “jack geller, walks in while you’re changing.”",[time lapse. ross and joey are cleaning the table while judy and phoebe talk by the window. jack and chandler are sitting on the couch while monica sits on the coffee table.]
6,9,3,54,"look at it, isn’t it beautiful?",[looking at her truffle]
6,9,3,56,"it’s a truffle. it’s got all of these layers. first there’s a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which i made from scratch, then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sauteed with peas and onions, then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then i just put some whipped cream on top!",[joey and ross make impressed faces] [joey and ross look like something’s wrong.] [joey and ross make confused faces.]
6,9,3,58,"the beef? yeah, that was weird to me, too. but then, y’know, i thought “well, there’s mincemeat pie,” i mean that’s an english dessert, these people just put very strange things in their food, y’know. oh! by the way, can i borrow some rum from your place?",[to joey]
6,9,3,60,and while i’m gone don’t you boys sneak a taste. joey and,[teasingly]
6,9,3,72,"joey, god, your apartment is like a hundred degrees!",
6,9,3,74,no!,
6,9,3,77,yeah?,
6,9,6,3,"no, i did, but tell me again, because it’s so romantic.",[sarcastically]
6,9,6,5,"joey! come on! i don’t wanna make any mistakes, alright? this is the only dessert and if i screw it up everybody's gonna be like “oh, remember that thanksgiving when rachel screwed up the trifle?”",[joey gives her an understanding look.]
6,9,6,6,"so why don’t you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it, alright?",
6,9,7,7,okay...,[the hallway. rachel and ross go out and they just stand there for a few seconds.]
6,9,7,8,"what’s up, ross?",
6,9,7,10,yeah!,
6,9,7,12,"oh no. no ross, don’t do this.",
6,9,7,14,i just- i don’t think us getting back together is a good idea.,
6,9,7,16,"i thought this might happen today. ross, i know the holidays can be rough. y’know? and it’s probably really hard for you to be alone right now.",
6,9,7,18,"no, i-i live with phoebe. i mean you’re alone , alone. and i just-it’s just not the time for us. i’m sorry.",[pity-tone]
6,9,7,23,"joey, you’re gonna have to stop rushing me, you know what? you don’t get any dessert.",
6,9,7,25,"no, i’m just kidding i would never do that to you! okay, everybody, it’s trifle time!",
6,9,7,27,it sure is.,
6,9,7,29,beef.,
6,9,7,31,"alright, monica, i want you to have the first taste.",
6,9,7,33,"oh oh oh, wait! you only got whipped cream in there! ya gotta take a bite with all the layers!",
6,9,7,35,"op! wait, you dropped a pea.",[monica puts the pea on top of the spoonful and takes a bite.]
6,9,7,36,well?,
6,9,7,38,really? how good?,
6,9,7,45,"okay, now what was that all about? is it-does it not taste good? let me try it.",[rachel reaches for ross’s plate]
6,9,7,51,"...so a bird just grabbed it, and then tried to fly away with it and, and then just dropped it on the street?","[chandler makes a fake ""i know i couldn’t believe it either"" gesture.]"
6,9,7,54,"oh, phoebe, do i wanna hear this?",
6,9,7,56,"oh my god, he dream-cheated on you!",[humoring phoebe]
6,9,7,76,i wasn’t supposed to put beef in the trifle!,"[reading the recipe magazine, finally figuring out that...]"
6,9,8,0,"you guys! it was bananas, cream, and beef! i-i just cannot believe that you ate that so that i wouldn’t feel bad!",
6,10,1,1,"that’s a good story, grandpa.",[ross enters]
6,10,2,1,"so, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story.",[joey enters]
6,10,2,28,"well, i used to date him, but you’re still going out with her!",[gunther brings janine a coffee]
6,10,2,35,"yeah, but she also invited you and ross. yeah, honey, i’m sorry, but i don’t think that was a romantic thing.",
6,10,2,37,"well, that’s a lot better than ross trying to kiss me in high school, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick.",
6,10,4,0,"okay, you look in the kitchen, i will look in the back closet.",
6,10,4,3,we are looking for our christmas presents from monica.,
6,10,4,8,"don’t worry, we’re just gonna search here for an hour, them we’re gonna go over to joey’s and search, ok?",
6,10,4,14,"chandler, aren’t you worried about what to get monica for christmas?",
6,10,4,17,"chandler, that’s not enough. i mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? and you’ve just gotten her one great present? i mean that’s just gonna make her feel bad. why would you do that to her chandler? why? why?",
6,10,4,19,that’s right!,[phoebe looks under the couch]
6,10,4,21,"oh, it’s a macy’s bag!","[phoebe tips it upside down, and a shoe falls out]"
6,10,4,23,"dear losers, do you really think i’d hide presents under the couch? p.s. chandler, i knew they’d break you.",[reading]
6,10,4,25,we are so gonna find them this year.,
6,10,4,27,yeah.,
6,10,4,29,"no, we never do that",[they turn away.]
6,10,6,1,"yeah, we found them. there were in the guest room closet behind some coats.",
6,10,6,5,"well chandler, what is this very weird, metal a z thing?",
6,10,6,8,ha!,
6,10,6,10,"yes, okay, oh, by the way, i just gotta say, i think it's really nice of you that even after you've moved, you still keep storing that stuff for joey!",[chandler does the weird clicky thing again.]
6,10,10,7,"hey, this is hollow.",
6,10,10,9,"this bench, it’s hollow! i can’t believe i never knew that! oh, the presents!!!",[she pushes all the pillows off it and opens it up]
6,10,10,13,"oh, this one’s for me!",

6,10,10,21,and rachel why?,
6,10,10,23,"whatever linus, i’m opening mine.",
6,10,12,1,"uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from eighth grade?",

6,11,5,8,i know you did! i bought the same one! and if she sees your table she’s gonna know that i lied to her. i told her ours was an original.,
6,11,5,10,because she hates pottery barn,
6,11,5,12,"i know! i know, she says it’s all mass-produced, nothing is authentic, and everyone winds up having the same stuff. so come on, she’s gonna be here any second! can we please just cover this up with something?! please?",[ross looks at his table.]
6,11,5,14,"ooo! oh, i forgot they made sheets!",
6,11,5,16,"ross, get over it! it’s not like she hates you.",

6,11,8,12,oh yes.,
6,11,10,0,"…see i can’t decide whether it would go better next to the new wicker dining chair, the sahara desk, or the parker console table.",
6,11,10,2,"i know, i know. i went a little crazy.",
6,11,10,5,hey.,
6,11,10,9,"oh it does, it does! it is a room separating apparatus from colonial times.",

6,12,1,12,"i’m sorry, i was just reading the joke below it. man, that one is funny.",[ross grabs the magazine away from her.]
6,12,3,3,we are looking at a playboy,
6,12,3,6,"oh, yeah, sure. i mean, like in the case of this young woman, she has lost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, she’s crying out, ‘where are they, where are they?’",
6,12,3,10,"you see, now, i would date this girl. she’s cute, she’s outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire. i mean, that’s got to come in handy",

6,12,8,4,"come on, joey, i did it and it was fine.",
6,12,8,10,"well, you know what? this is great. finally, i have someone i can pass on my wisdom too. let me tell you about a couple of things i learned while working at the coffeehouse. first of all, the customer is always right. a smile goes a long way. and if anyone is ever rude to you? sneeze muffin.",[joey nods.] [joey smiles]
6,12,9,0,phoebe. we would like to talk to you for a second.,

6,12,12,21,"he left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when you’ve been working here two days? that’s not, that’s not right.",
6,12,12,23,"joey, you can’t let him get away with that. ya know what, i’m not going to let him get away with that. i’m going to say something to him—no, i really shouldn’t say anything—no, i should say something to him. gunther, i want you to give joey his job back. that is really not fair that you have to fire him…",[goes to the counter]
6,12,12,25,what?,

6,13,3,44,"all right, it’s okay. one little setback is okay, just don’t let it happen again, all right? now since daddy paid for all this stuff, i should take it all away. but i’m just gonna take the-the pajmena. and the uh, and the uh pants. y’know what, i’m just gonna take it all away, ‘cause that way you’ll just really learn the lesson. okay? all righty, i’m gonna run a couple of errands and i will see you at dinner.",[ross hands it to her.] [leaves with all of jill’s stuff.]
6,13,5,0,hey!,
6,13,5,2,what’s up?!,
6,13,5,4,"well, it’d better not be about the apartment pants, because i just pitched the idea to my boss at ralph lauren and she loved it.",
6,13,5,6,what?!,
6,13,5,8,with ross and jill?,
6,13,5,10,with ross and my sister?,

7,2,5,12,"hey-hey, y’know what? i don’t care! i’m not ashamed of my book. there’s nothing with a woman enjoying a little…erotica. it’s just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand.",[she goes into her room.]

7,3,7,16,"excuse me, i wanted you to help, but you couldn’t move your arms because you were wearing three life jackets.",
7,3,7,18,"look joey, i’m sorry if-if you thought that was mean, but i gotta tell ya something. that was not mean. okay, my father is mean. he used to yell at me all the time on the boat, i mean it was horrible. i was just being a good teacher.",

7,3,9,12,"okay joey, we’re luffing a little bit, so could you tighten up the cunningham?",[the mainsail has started to flap in the wind and has stopped working efficiently; she wants him to tighten it so that it starts working again.]

7,3,9,16,"no! all right?! i did not see the bird! i did not see the fish! i did not see the piece of styrofoam that was shaped like mike tyson! i did not , because i was trying to teach you how to sail a boat! which obviously is an impossible thing to do!",[angrily]

7,12,7,10,"yes i did! and i put a little post-it on it that said, ""must go out today,"" and underlined today three times and, and then i put a little heart in the corner because i didn’t want to seem to bossy.",
7,12,7,12,"y’know what tag, if we went down to the office you would see those contracts sitting on your desk.",
7,12,7,14,or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on the phone with your crotch!,

7,12,11,5,"in the afternoon. mr. zelner came into my office after lunch. he put them on my desk, and then i put a post-it on it that said, ""must go out today."" so you just keep looking in there! all right? commercial break",[looks down onto her desk and finds the folder with the post-it on it that contains the contracts she imagined she gave tag]

7,13,3,2,"okay, come on—joey, i’ll buy you a new one! all right? we’ll go down to the store right now and we’ll-we’ll get you a new chair.",
7,13,3,4,"but don’t you think rosita would’ve wanted you to move on? i mean y’know, she did always put…your comfort first.",

7,13,10,5,"well look, if you don’t like this…",[the audience’s laughter at chandler’s progress cuts out the rest of rachel’s line.]

7,13,10,10,"joey, the new chair will be here in an hour. maybe we should actually move rosita out of here. y’know, start the heeling process?",
7,13,10,12,that’s weird.,
7,13,10,14,it’s not a miracle joey! i’m sure there’s some explanation.,
7,13,10,16,"joey, i really don’t…",
7,13,10,18,well no.,
7,13,10,20,"no, y’know what? maybe somebody came in here and fixed it! or something!",
7,13,10,22,"that’s right joey, the chair angel came in and heeled your chair.",[she sits down in the chair.]
7,13,12,0,i am so psyched i kept this chair for myself!,[grabbing a beer out of the chair’s fridge]
7,13,12,2,"hey, how’s…how’s the uh, miracle chair?",

7,13,12,6,yeah! you can hook it up to your tv and you get radio!,
7,13,15,0,hey chandler!,
7,13,15,2,"how would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines, has a rolling massage, and speakers in the head rest?",
7,13,15,4,"well what if i told you, you can do it in my apartment?",
7,13,15,6,i just purchased the la-z-boy e-cliner 3000 .,"[which is an actual product by the way, i’m not sure about the 3000 part.]"
7,13,15,8,"well, it’s a long story, but umm i broke joey’s chair…",

7,13,15,24,"uh-huh! nice try, but you don’t get that chair anymore! all right? that is my chair now! you can sit on my lap! no i take that back!",[joey starts to get up.]
7,13,15,28,no-no-no! this chair’s not going anywhere.,
7,13,15,30,"the logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half!",

7,14,4,0,"thirty. ugh, i mean thirty! monica, do you remember mean, old mrs. kreeger in the fifth grade? she was thirty!",
7,14,4,2,nothing. i don’t want to do anything.,

7,14,6,0,"y’know what? i am going to do something today. i’m not just gonna sit around like some old lady. i’m gonna get something pierced. like my uh, like my nose or my tongue or something.",
7,14,6,2,so what?! y’know what? the way i see it— —ow! son of a bitch!!,[phoebe pulls out a hair from the back of her head]

7,14,10,12,"no, i know! i get it! it’s funny!",[crying]
7,14,10,14,"no i know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and i don’t have any of those things. that’s why it’s so funny.",[runs into her room crying.]
7,14,11,1,"well, i feel fine, but i think you’re bumming out the rest of the kids.",
7,14,11,3,okay! y’know what? i realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids. all i really needed was a plan. see i wanna have three kids…,
7,14,11,5,as i was saying… i should probably have the first of the three kids by the time i’m 35 which gives me five years. i love this plan! i wanna marry this plan!,
7,14,11,7,"so, if i wanna have my kid when i’m 35, i don’t have to get pregnant until i’m 34. which gives prada four years to start making maternity clothes! oh wait, but i do want to be married for a year before i get pregnant…",
7,14,11,9,"no, so i don’t have to get married until i’m 33! that’s three years, that’s three whole years—oh, wait a minute though. i’ll need a year and a half to plan the wedding, and i’d like to know the guy for a year, year and a half before we get engaged… which means i need to meet the guy by the time i’m thirty.",
7,14,11,11,"no! ross, no! it is not fine! eh-eh-according to my plan i should already be with the guy i wanna marry!","[we hear tag scream out in the hallway and jump into view of the open door on the scooter. he gives a hearty thumbs up to the group and rides off, with joey following breathlessly behind.]"
7,14,12,0,i’m telling you it’s like watching bambi learn how to walk.,[to chandler]
7,14,13,9,"hey. oh, poor pheebs.",[after she leaves.]

7,15,2,7,"all right, straight, and not subtle.",[the man gets up and leaves.]
7,15,2,9,"oh, well, we can hand it to gunther and he'll put it in lost and found.",
7,15,2,11,"what if, um, if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and i answer and we start talking and we fell in love. i mean wouldn't that be a great story? kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age.",
7,15,2,13,what? wait! why…why do you get the story?,

7,15,2,23,"well umm, maybe we could uhh… ah-ha! too slow!!",[grabs the phone] [she holds the phone out and starts taunting phoebe. phoebe calming knocks the phone out of rachel’s hand and catches it.]
7,15,4,0,"no phoebe! you cannot get the phone that way; that’s not fair! okay look, i have an idea. why don’t we, why don’t we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him. and then whoever does gets the phone.",
7,15,4,2,i don’t think so.,
7,15,4,4,"all right, first name on the speed dial is mom.",[checking the speed dial]
7,15,4,6,"okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.",

9,14,14,20,"well, he makes t-shirts for a living, and he thought it would be appropriate to give me this.","[she holds up a black t-shirt with ""fbi - female body inspector"" on the front.]"
9,14,14,30,"oh. huh. you know, it is weird that phoebe would set me up on a date that was awful on the same night that joey set you up on a date that didn't even show.",

9,23,22,33,aaahhhh!,"[joey hurriedly stands up, arms akimbo, gives her an embarrassed look and walks away]"
9,23,26,13,what?,"[joey says nothing, but enters the room and kisses her. they are kissing passionately only to stop for a brief ""oh"" from rachel. they continue their passionate kiss and joey closes the door with his foot and it shuts in the camera's ""face"". and that's the end of the ninth season.]"
10,1,1,22,ooh... i love barbados!,"[through wall] [phoebe starts to listen at the other wall, where rachel's room is. there, joey and rachel are kissing.]"

10,1,1,71,"oh, ju-ju-just stay calm. just be calm. for all he knows we're just hanging out together. right? just be nonchalant. that's not nonchalant!","[joey like stands at attention with his chest forward and his hands on his sides, looking up at the ceiling with his lips pouted.]"
10,1,1,73,"oh... okay, just hide!",
10,1,1,75,"coming! try under the bed, try under the bed!","[when rachel starts to look under the bed if joey would fit under there, chandler opens the door inbetween the rooms, grabs joey by his shirt and drags him to his room, and closes the door again]"
10,1,1,76,there's no room under the bed.,[looks around because she can't find joey anymore]

10,1,1,90,"oh, i know... i know it's been really hard for you.",[still searching]
10,1,1,92,"that is hard to say, ross. that is hard to say.",[now looking up at the ceiling]
10,1,1,94,you would think!,[ross leaves the room]
10,1,1,95,joey!,
10,1,1,97,how are you doing this?,"[still can't find him] [joey now enters the room through the door, monica, chandler and phoebe are following him.]"

10,1,1,102,"ah, what is this? well, lets see, we kissed for ten minutes and now we're talking to our friends about it, so i guess this is sixth grade!",
10,1,1,107,"all right, look you guys... look, we appreciate all the advice, but this is between joey and me and i think we can handle it...",
10,1,1,109,sure...,

10,1,1,114,"yeah... yeah , we can wait, we don't have to do anything tonight",
10,1,1,116,although...,[joey walks to the door]
10,1,1,118,"i mean, you know... ross and i haven't dated in like... six years...",
10,1,1,120,"plus, you know, he is with charlie now.",
10,1,1,122,no...,
10,1,1,124,yeah...,
10,1,1,126,forgotten.,"[they want to kiss, but just before their lips touch, rachel pulls back quickly, gasping]"
10,1,1,128,nothing...,
10,1,1,130,"nothing... it's really... it's nothing... come here, come here...","[again, just before their lips touch, she pulls back, gasping]"
10,1,1,132,"sorry, i just uhm... i can't seem to get ross out of my head...",
10,1,3,30,ross is coming over. i think now would be a really good time to talk to him.,
10,1,3,32,"okay, well keep in mind that by the time you're done, they'll probably be serving dinner.",
10,1,3,34,still nervous?,
10,1,3,37,yeah!,
10,1,3,39,"yeah, yeah sure! yeah!","[mouths ""good luck"" to joey and gets up from her seat]"
10,1,3,64,so hi!,

10,1,3,72,"ah... well, obviously i think so too.",
10,1,3,74,really? excited?,
10,1,3,76,"excuse me! you didn't tell him, did you?","[and she walks back to joey, who is still looking very impressed about what ross said to him. rachel looks at him and hits him.]"
10,1,3,78,"oh god! alright, fine. you know what joey, forget it. when we go back to new york, i will tell him.",
10,1,6,1,"that was one time, ross, and they were only like 5 milligrams.",

10,1,6,15,"wow! well, clearly this is not a good time.",
10,1,9,1,hi!,
10,1,9,3,"well, i tried, but then he had a shampoo related emergency. so i guess now it's your turn again.",
10,1,9,5,"yeah, 'cause that's what we do.",
10,1,9,7,"okay, that sounds fair. it just means that once again we can't...",
10,1,9,9,"no! of course we can wait. alright, so i guess that means good night then?",
10,1,9,11,goo--ood night!,
10,1,9,13,"seriously, good night!",
10,1,9,15,okay. commercial break,"[now they kiss passionately... and then ross enters with emma. they freeze, pull away and look at ross who looks like he just can't believe what he's seeing. joey straightens his shirt, and rachel says i'm so-oo sorry , and presses her breasts together, just like joey did before.]"
10,2,1,1,we weren't doing anything!,

10,3,7,17,"i do not know what's wrong with us, i mean, we have kissed before and that's been great! but this time it was leading somewhere and i was very aware of the fact that it was joey touching me.",

10,3,12,7,"no, no, no... no, i mean... se-x-u-ally...",

10,4,3,10,"oh, you're gonna love this cake. i got it from a bakery in new jersey, corino’s.",
10,4,3,12,"well, anyway, they make these great novelty cakes, in all different shapes, and if you give them a photo, they’ll copy it in icing!",

10,4,3,18,"why you guys this isn't funny, all right? if i wanted this cake to be a disaster i would have baked it myself!",
10,4,3,23,"no, no, this is not what i ordered. ok? i went all the way to new jersey so that i could have the perfect cake for my daughter’s birthday and i need a bunny cake, right now!",[on the phone]
10,4,3,25,"oh! believe you me! i am going to bring this cake back, i don't even want it in my home... joey, don't touch it!!",[turns towards the cake and sees joey trying to take a piece and yells at him]
10,4,3,27,"yes, yes. i still want my daughters picture, but on a bunny cake. yellow cake, chocolate frosting with nuts!",[speaking to the person on the phone again]
10,4,4,0,"no, there isn't time to go to the bakery. we're just gonna come home... everybody left? alright, well just tell emma we're gonna be there as soon as we can. bye...","[into the phone] [emotionally] [she hangs up, closes her phone, turns around and puts it in her bag which is in the back of the car. while doing this and not looking at the road, she turns the steering wheel by accident, which makes the car swerve.]"
10,4,4,2,ooh! god! sorry!,
10,4,4,4,emma's awake.,

10,4,4,8,"oh, why do you even bother? i already ruined her first birthday... and do you know how important these early experiences are ross? very! according to the back cover of that book that you gave me.",
10,4,4,10,"i guess... oh, i just had such an idea of what this day would be like, you know? emma laughing and everybody gathered around her cake singing ""happy birthday"". then we would all go into... hey get out of the road you stupid student driver!!! they have to learn!","[shakes her head] [honks furiously, and ross looks at her in disbelief and rachel looks at him.]"
10,4,4,12,what?,

10,5,1,0,"you know, i'm thinking about letting emma have her first cookie.",

10,5,4,20,"sometimes just nodding is ok. uhm, so but anyway, listen, not marrying barry was the best decision that i ever, ever made. honey, you deserve true love. your soulmate is out there, somewhere. someone that is your age, that is smart , that is fun and that you care about!",[pause]

10,5,8,9,"well, uhm... whatever, i have really appreciated it, 'cause i don’t think i would be the person that i am today if it wasn’t for you guys. see, i wanna help amy the way you guys helped me. and i know it’s gonna take patience, but that’s ok.",
10,5,8,12,"amy, that’s what i was supposed to wear today, that’s why i hung it on the door.",
10,5,8,14,"amy, you know what? i was thinking that maybe now it'd be a good time for us to sit down and, you know, talk about your future.",

10,15,5,9,"no, i’m still going.",
10,15,5,11,"when the louis vuitton people found out that ralph lauren wanted me back, the offered me more money! isn’t that great?",

10,16,13,2,"i cannot believe that after ten years, you do not know one thing about me.",
10,16,13,4,"because it is too damn hard ross. i can't even begin to explain to you how much i'm gonna miss you. when i think about not seeing you every day, it makes me not want to go... okay, so if you think that i didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. it's because you mean more to me. so there, all right, there's your goodbye... oh!",
