5,6,7,10,why?,
5,6,7,12,what's going on?,
5,6,7,19,"unreasonable? how about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married! you have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work! all right, it's about compromise! do you always like it? no! do you do it? yes! because it's not all laughing, happy, candy in the sky, drinking coffee at central perk all the time! it's real life, okay? it's what grown-ups do!",[he storms out.]

5,8,9,31,monica!,"[in a high pitched voice] [time lapse, dinner has finished and chandler is sitting on the couch eating some pie. monica sits down beside him, and he gets pushed up a little by the wave she makes in the couch.]"

5,11,5,5,thanks.,"[gets up and as he does so, the sound returns. without another word he heads into her bathroom.] [cut to elizabeth hornswoggle's bathroom, ross frantically pulls his shirt out and drops his pants. he exhales in sheer ecstasy as the coolness of the bathroom envelops his legs. he sits on the cast iron bathtub, again gasping in pleasure. he next grabs a magazine and starts to blow air on his exposed legs, but that doesn't work the way he wants it to. so he throws the magazine down, looks around for another idea, and finds one. he jumps up and hops to the sink. he turns on the water and starts to splash some on his legs, cooling them further.]"
5,11,5,6,ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh……….,[in ecstasy]

5,12,15,4,"well, because y'know there are certain rules about this kind of stuff. you don't uh, you don't fool around with your uh, friend's ex-girlfriends or possible girlfriends or girls they're related to.",

6,2,3,27,"and if you wait right here, i’ll go get ross.",[phoebe grabs his arm and prevents him from escaping.]
6,2,5,0,"…once you know the stories, it’s not that bad. first marriage, wife’s hidden sexuality, not my fault. second marriage, said the wrong name at the altar, a little my fault. third marriage, well they really shouldn’t allow you to get married when you’re that drunk and have writing all over your face, nevada’s fault.",

6,3,2,3,"oh, that. umm, she took it really well.",
6,3,2,5,no.,
6,3,2,7,"i am not in love with her. she was very upset about having to move out so i eh, didn’t tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset. i-i just comforted her, as a friend.",
6,3,2,9,"it’s nothing, i just gave her a hug.",
6,3,2,11,it’s also a sign of friendship.,
6,3,2,13,it was a hug!,[grabs back his cookie]
6,3,2,15,s-s-smell her hair? what if i did?,
6,3,2,17,"i was hugging her as a friend. it’s not my fault her-her hair got in my face, she’s got a lot of it and it smells all-all uh…coconutty. what?! oh, that doesn’t mean i have feelings for rachel! maybe it means i have feelings for coconuts!",[phoebe raises her eyebrows.]
6,3,2,19,"if the place you are referring too is being in love, then she is in the same place as me because i am not in that place!",[grabbing back his coffee]
6,3,5,8,hey!,[entering]
6,3,5,10,"rach, uh, you still looking for a place?",

6,3,5,14,"don’t thank me! if you wanna thank something, thank the volcano that erupted thousands of years ago, killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization. here’s warren’s number.",[rachel just looks at him.]
6,3,5,16,"okay, you go grab it!",
6,3,5,18,i don’t know what you’re talking about.,
6,3,5,20,"look, i do not re-love her.",

6,3,5,24,you can live with me.,
6,3,5,27,what? commercial break,
6,3,6,1,uh-huh.,[phoebe grunts.]
6,3,6,3,"well, i’m-i’m just glad i could, y’know, help you out.",
6,3,6,6,"hero, i uh, i don’t know—well, all right.",
6,3,6,8,"oh please! you’re gonna say things now, aren’t ya?",[he sits down.] [to phoebe]
6,3,9,1,"hey! oh listen, i was just clearing some space for your stuff.",
6,3,9,3,"what do you mean, they’re not moving in? they-they’re still moving in right?",
6,3,9,5,what?! over a stupid room!,
6,3,9,7,"oh no, yeah no, that part’s great!",
6,3,10,0,"what’s all this about you guys fighting?! is this really over a room?! i mean, that is so silly!",
6,3,10,2,"well, apparently not, and i can’t just stand by and watch two people i care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. i mean, enough of the silliness!",
6,3,10,4,"okay-okay! two very good points, look i’ve known you both a long time, and i’ve never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as you’ve been since you’ve got together. do you really want to throw that all away over a room? that is so silly. now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?",[stopping them]
6,3,10,10,"okay! all right! now, chandler you-you wanna live with monica, right?",
6,3,10,12,"and mon, you wanna live with chandler, don’t ya?",
6,3,10,14,good! a verbal contract is binding in the state of new york!,[jumping up] [storms out.]
6,3,11,5,hey rach!,[entering]
6,3,11,7,"you’re never gonna believe it uh, monica and chandler are moving in again. that’s great news right—i mean for them. right?",
6,3,11,9,"yeah but, on the bright side, we get to be roommates again.",
6,3,11,11,"wh-why?! why-why-why would it, why would it be weird?",
6,3,11,13,no!,
6,3,11,15,"no! no! it would be weird if we were still in that place, i mean are you still in that place?",
6,3,11,17,good! me neither! so it’s not a problem. we’re just two friends who happen to be roommates.,
6,3,11,19,really?! we are?,
6,3,11,21,ohh! that would be great.,
6,3,11,23,"yeah, i didn’t think of that.","[laughs as well, but for a different reason]"
6,3,12,0,so are you sure about this whole moving in thing?! i mean it’s a really big step! and-and what’s the rush?!,[they both start laughing at him.]
6,3,12,3,"no, i-i-i’m serious, okay? i mean, think about it. you move in, you start fighting over stupid game rooms, next thing y’know you break up!",
6,3,12,5,"okay, there are no stupid fights!! this isn’t about the room, this is about what the room…represents! and unfortunately, this room could destroy you!!",[points to rachel’s room]
6,3,12,8,"fine! it’s your life! i just don’t want to see you guys break up! which you will do if you move in together, but that’s what you want, there’s nothing i can do. don’t do it !!!!!","[starts to storm out mad about his failed attempt at the manipulation of his best friend and sister, but stops and tries one last time.] [monica and chandler just stare at him.] [opens the door and tries one more time.] [finally leaves.]"

6,3,13,23,"whoa! whoa! whoa, joey!",

6,4,4,20,"i knew all i had to do was let the material speak for itself. everyone’s all, ""ross you have to be funny and sexy."" well, i proved them wrong! and now, i’m gonna pass the news onto joey and chandler.",
6,4,4,22,that’s right!,
6,4,7,3,"right! so when rigby got his samples back from the laboratory he made a startling discovery! what he believed to be igneous, was in fact sedimentary. imagine his consternation when— oh bloody hell. commercial break",[to the class] [sees monica and rachel.]
6,4,8,1,"look, i was nervous! you guys had me all worried i was going to be boring! i got up there and they were all like staring at me. i opened my mouth and this british accent just came out.",

6,4,10,11,they’re not listening too me?,
6,4,10,13,monica you really think i should try this phasing out thing?,
6,4,17,0,"all right, keep going. we are phasing the accent out, phasing it out. so without out re-testing the results in the laboratory the team would never have identified the initial errors in their carbon dating analysis . were there any questions at this point? yes.",[in his head] [pronounced the british way] [british] [british] [one student raises his hand.] [points to him.]
6,4,17,2,"come again? what’s-what’s this nonsense? all right, i’m-i’m not english. i’m from long island. i was really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out. i’m sorry. so, if we could just get back to the lecture. umm, were there any questions? about paleontology. all right, look i was just trying to make a good first impression. obviously, i screwed up. but what you guys think of me is really important because i’m-i’m hoping to get a permanent job here. so if you just give me another chance to make a good impression…","[british] [giggles.] [american.] [everyone raises their hands] [they all put their hands down.] [at this moment rachel bursts through the door. needless to say, she’s not in the best of moods having just found out ross’s dirty little secret.]"

6,5,1,1,look i was going to tell you!,
6,5,1,7,"okay, maybe it wasn’t my best decision. but i just couldn’t face another failed marriage.",
6,5,1,9,"rach, come on, if you think about it, it’s actually kinda funny. okay, maybe it’s best not to think about it.","[he laughs, and he laughs alone.]"

6,15,1,30,"hey, do you guys think that if all those things happened, we’d still hang out? oh no ! these credits are based on the world that would have been created had all of the above actually happened. it starts out with all of them at the fountain sitting on the couch as fat monica runs up and sits on the arm of the couch, tilting the whole thing towards her. it then goes on to show rachel’s still a shop-aholic and with barry. fat monica is sweating while cooking and dancing while eating a donut. phoebe as the wall street shark smoking while on two cell phones. then they’re dancing in the fountain. joey entering as dr. drake remoray and meeting a groupie. chandler trying to write as a bird does its business on his shoulder and falling asleep while typing. ross doing some kara-tay and trying to get carol into bed. and finally, some more dancing in the fountain, them all flexing, and the turning out the lamp and shutting off all the lights bit from the first season. just remember one thing, this is an alternate universe. everything from every other episode doesn’t apply, for instance, ross and rachel have no history. and in fact have not seen each other in years in this world.}",

6,15,27,17,hey! there are some men who will do whatever it takes to make their marriage work! okay? there are some men who will stand by and-and watch as their wives engage in-in what only can be described as a two some with some-some woman she barely knows from the gym!,

6,17,2,15,"all right, maybe it means that too…",
6,17,2,17,y’know what? fine! get attacked! i don’t even care!,
6,17,2,19,unagi is a state of total awareness. okay? only by achieving true unagi can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you!,

6,17,5,5,"perhaps. now i’m curious, at what point during those girlish screams would you have begun to kick my ass?",
6,17,5,7,"i’m sorry i had to take such drastic measures to make my point, but i—look, i just want you guys to be safe. danger !!!!! ahhh, huh? unagi.",[monica comes out to throw out the garbage and ross screams…] [she completely ignores him and keeps walking.]

6,17,7,9,"y’know what? she’d-she’d love this. uh, it’s an exact replica of apollo 8. i made it in the sixth grade.","[picks up a model of the saturn v rocket, that’s the one that took man to the moon.]"
6,17,7,11,"yeah-yeah, except apollo 8 didn’t actually land on the moon. but you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely.","[apollo 8 was the first one that orbited the moon and the one that read the christmas story from the orbit of the moon on christmas eve, 1968. they also took the famous earthrise picture of the earth rising over the moon.]"
6,17,7,13,why not?,
6,17,7,15,oh. phoebe and,[chandler leaves dejectedly. when the door closes rachel and phoebe jump out from behind the curtains and scream…]
6,17,10,8,it’s not something you are! it’s something you have!,
6,17,10,10,"y’know what? i can easily get out of this, but there is a chance you can get very, very hurt!",[rachel yanks on his legs again and he groans in pain.]
6,17,13,1,it’s a great class.,
6,17,13,3,"yeah, yeah, i was watching. umm, hey, a couple of questions though. umm, about that-that-that last move where the woman tripped you and then pinned you to the floor, what-what-what-what would you do next?",[the instructor just nods and walks away.]
6,17,13,5,no. no-no. no. what would you do next?,
6,17,13,7,yes that’s right.,
6,17,13,9,"i tired attacking two women, did not work.",
6,17,13,11,"no, i mean it’s okay, i mean, they’re-they’re my friends. in fact, i-i-i was married to one of them.",
6,17,13,13,"oh, no! no-no! no, i tired! but i couldn’t. that’s why i’m here. maybe we could attack them together? that-that’s a no.",[he glares at him.]
6,17,15,0,"ah-ha, nowhere to run!","[he starts to run towards them.] [cut to central perk, phoebe and rachel are sitting up by the window because two guys have their couch.]"
6,17,15,4,danger !!!!,

6,18,1,5,yeah.,
6,18,1,9,"it’s a girl! anyway, it wou—it wouldn’t matter. okay? because i’m a teacher and she’s a student.",
6,18,1,11,"no, but it is frowned upon.",
6,18,1,13,"besides, there’s a big age difference.",
6,18,1,15,i know when i’m 90 she’ll be like 80 and it won’t seem like such a big difference.,
6,18,3,2,yeah?,[startled]

6,18,9,9,"listen, i gotta tell ya, i-i’m having a great time! y’know how before you said it might be weird, the whole student teacher thing, and to be frank i thought it would be too, but it’s not. i mean it’s not at all.",
6,18,9,11,burt!,[pushing elizabeth into a doorway]
6,18,13,0,"we had such a great time! she’s-she’s incredible! i thought the-the age difference might be a problem, but it wasn’t. it wasn’t at all. elizabeth is very mature for her age. a concept lost on some people!",[joey makes the international sign for big boobies.] [to monica]
6,18,13,2,"well, not really. i mean technically it’s-it’s not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon. especially by that professor we ran into last night, judgey von holierthanthou.",
6,18,13,4,yeah. what-what should i do?,
6,18,13,13,going out with who?,
6,18,13,15,oh yeah! wasn’t she uh…,[does the international sign for big boobies.]

6,18,17,4,"y’know i remember when uh, when i was in college, we used to…",[he sees some of his colleagues enter and puts his head on her lap.]
6,18,17,6,"nothing, i’m-i’m just, i’m so comfortable with you!",
6,18,17,8,"what? no! of course, of course i do! are-are they gone?",
6,18,17,10,"what?! no! no! wait! you’re right, this is stupid. who cares what people think? i mean, i mean we like each other right? there’s nothing wrong with that. come on. burt? lydia? mel? this is elizabeth.",[they get up and go over to the table where his colleagues are sitting.]
6,18,17,13,"that’s right lydia, elizabeth here is a student and uh, we’re dating. and you may frown upon that, but we’re not gonna hide it anymore.",
6,18,17,15,what?,
6,18,17,17,really? its not just frowned upon?,
6,18,19,0,wow! it actually is in the handbook. i can’t date you or have a hot plate in my office. i can’t believe we have to stop seeing each other.,
6,18,19,2,"i know, i know i really like you too. but we-we can’t date. it’s against the rules. it’s forbidden.",

6,19,2,36,"i don’t know rachel, why?",
6,19,2,39,well thanks!,
6,19,2,42,"well, actually it’s been great. she’s 20 so she’s not looking for anything too serious, which is perfect for me right now.",
6,19,2,44,"thanks. i know you guys like to give me a hard time and all, but it really means a lot to me that you like her. just knowing that you guys are…",
6,19,5,1,"hmm? oh, a student i don’t know.",[turns around and sees that its elizabeth]
6,19,5,3,"yes, yes of course, what-what would this be regarding?",
6,19,5,5,"shh! of course, why don’t we go inside?","[laughs then composes himself] [they go inside and ross closes the door. when he turns around elizabeth walks up to him, pushes him back against the door, and starts kissing him.]"

6,19,6,2,"i can do that. oh-oh, what if she gets upset?",
6,19,6,5,what the hell are you doing?,
6,19,6,7,"what?! what? how do you, how do you even know its broken?!",
6,19,6,11,"joey, i did not break this! okay? that has been broken for a while.",[he opens the freezer and smells inside and recoils in disgust.]
6,19,6,15,do not give him any money!,
6,19,7,1,"yes. yes! please, come in.","[she does so, he closes the door, and she pushes him against the doorknob again.]"

6,19,8,8,"hey, y’know what? not all spring breaks are like that.",
6,19,8,10,i went to egypt with my dad.,

6,19,8,14,i’m gonna call her.,
6,19,9,16,"well, it turns out that she is going to daytona for spring break woo-hoo. that means, that means wet t-shirt contests, guys doing shots off of girl’s bodies, waking up next to people you don’t even know…",

6,19,12,4,"it was pretty funny when i, when i hid it for a while, huh? anyway, umm, i-i am worried about that bathing suit, not because it’s revealing which i’m fine with, no i’m concerned about your health, sun exposure.",
6,19,12,6,"well, if what’s in the bottle is actually 30. i mean sometimes you get 30, sometimes it’s-it’s get 4, and i swear to god more often than not it’s just milk.",

7,5,13,5,"well, i don’t think we are gonna have that problem, but maybe that’s just because i am not emotionally unavailable!",

7,7,2,5,"oh umm, there’s also a book here by a woman named wendy bagina. what is that?","[stopping quickly] [they both laugh, but stop when the hear moaning coming from the next aisle.]"
7,7,5,0,people are doing it in front of my book!,
7,7,5,2,"my doctoral dissertation is in the library at school, i went to see it, and there were students makin’ babies right in the middle of the paleontology section!",
7,7,5,4,"let me ask you something, at your school was there a like uh a place on campus where students went to uh, fool around.",

7,7,6,2,no! no!! no! can i speak to someone in charge please?!,[the librarian brings his boss over.]
7,7,6,4,"hi, i was wondering if it is possible to increase security in the paleontology section? see i-i wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it.",
7,7,6,6,"well, fine. fine! if-if i’m the only person with any appreciation of the sanctity of the written word, i’ll go up there and defend it myself! and don’t you follow me!","[starts to do so, but stops and to the previous librarian]"

7,7,10,2,"oh-oh, you’re-you’re fellow scholars. what exactly were you looking for, hmm? perhaps, perhaps dr. chester stock’s musings on the smiledon californicus?",[grabs a book from the shelf behind him]
7,7,10,4,"ah… ah…get out of here! uh, meeting someone? or-or are you just here to brush up on marion’s views on evolution?",[the couple retreats. ross starts looking through the previously mentioned book as a beautiful woman walks into the section.]

7,7,10,8,"i’m a professor here uh, ross…geller.",
7,7,10,10,yes! you’re the person who checked out my book?!,
7,7,10,12,"well i uh, i skipped forth grade.","[time lapse, ross and the woman are now in a state of partial undress and are standing in front of the head librarian with two security guards watching them.]"
7,7,10,13,i am very…very sorry.,
7,7,13,0,"don’t sweat it, i’ve got this section covered. yeah, in fact i’ve got this little baby to shine in people’s eye— —okay, see you later.","[to the guard] [turns on a mini-flashlight] [the guard walks away] [ross resumes his patrol when his best friend and sister walk up and start to take off their coats, but they stop when they see him.]"

7,8,2,9,done! with time a-to-spare.,
7,8,2,11,"you know, i hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that a group of well-educated adults and joey can't name all the states. did you ever see a map, or one of those round, colorful things called ""a globe?"" hmm?",
7,8,2,13,what? that's impossible.,
7,8,2,17,"no, just give me another minute.",

7,8,7,13,monica's crying. she's very upset about this whole clunkers thing.,
7,8,7,15,"no. no, no. she doesn't want to see you right now.",
7,8,7,17,because you sent away the dog!,
7,8,7,19,"oh, is it? is it ? look, when monica and i were kids, we had a dog named rover. and, uh, one day, my dad decides, he doesn't like dogs. so monica and her friend…phyllis…take away the dog. and that was the last time we ever saw him. don't you see? this is just like that. only with a few details changed.",
7,8,7,27,"from you? yes, please!","[he does a weird desperate laughter, like he's almost crying]"
7,8,7,29,"i hate america! when i finish this game, i swear i am moving.",[joey stands up again. rachel enters the door]
7,8,7,52,"okay, maybe this is so hard, because there aren't 50 states. let me tell you something, i have 49 states, and there are no more! i-i think, i should be able to eat something.",
7,8,7,58,"tag? y-you're going? uh we didn't, uh we didn't get the chance to talk. uh, so, where did you say you're from again?",[comes over to tag]
7,8,7,60,"ah, what good are you.",[walks back to his map dejectedly.] [rachel and tag go into the hall.]
7,8,8,0,delaware! delaware!,[starting to cry.]
7,8,8,2,i want my turkey now!,[hands chandler his pad and walks in]
7,8,8,4,i know.,[pauses]

7,9,7,4,phoebe really likes the bike huh?,
7,9,7,7,"wait a minute, she was walking the bike? both times?","[cut to outside, they’re going to talk to phoebe about walking the bike.]"

7,9,9,0,"okay, now just remember everything i taught you and you’ll be fine. okay? here we go. ready…set…",
7,9,9,2,"phoebe, you can’t get out of this! okay? you have to learn how to ride a bike!",
7,9,9,4,well…in-in case of emergency.,
7,9,9,6,"well let there—what if a man comes along and puts a gun to your head and says, ""you ride this bike or i’ll sh…i’ll shoot you.""",
7,9,9,8,"okay, phoebe just-just get-get on the bike and—hey! i’ll hold you up and-and push you. okay?",

7,9,10,4,"by the way, the week before your wedding you may not see a lot of me.","[she glares at him and he quickly makes his way to phoebe’s room.] [cut to phoebe’s room, phoebe has put her helmet on one of her teddy bears and is playing around with it. ross knocks and pokes his head in the door.]"
7,9,10,6,"look, i-i’m really sorry i let go of the bike.",[entering]
7,9,10,8,"i know. i know. but, can we please try it again? huh? i mean, you were so close phoebe!",
7,9,10,10,phoebe.,
7,9,10,12,"all right, y’know what? if you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then i’m sorry, i’m just gonna have to take it back.",
7,9,10,14,"because! because, it-it-it’s… it’d be like you having this guitar and-and never playing it. okay, this guitar wants to be played! and-and this bike wants to be ridden and-and if you don’t ride it you-you’re-you’re killing its spirit! the bike is dying.",[points to hers] [pause]
7,9,10,16,great! great! you’re making the bike very happy.,[he runs to the door.]

7,10,5,8,"right, um, but, on hanukkah, hanukkah is a celebration of a miracle. see, years and years ago there were these people called the maccabees.",
7,10,5,10,"okay, that's right, yes, but on hanukkah, uh, we sing, uh dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, i made you out of clay",[interrupts him] [sings]

7,10,11,32,"i'm sorry, chandler but this, this is really important to me.",

7,10,13,0,"…and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that should’ve just lasted just one day, burned for…",
7,10,13,2,"that’s right, and that’s why we celebrate hanukkah today. the end.",

7,11,2,10,"thanks. oh! so for tomorrow, do you want to rent a car and drive down together or what?",[phoebe gets up to get a refill.] [to monica]
7,11,2,12,"cousin frannie’s wedding, its tomorrow night.",
7,11,2,14,no.,
7,11,2,17,"well l-look okay, it’s probably just a mistake. let me call aunt sheryl okay? maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail.",
7,11,2,19,"y’know, she tried to undress me too.",
7,11,3,5,"hey, y’know what nickname never caught on? the ross-a-tron!",[monica shakes her head in disgust.]
7,11,3,11,"phoebe he’s right, that is the rule.",
7,11,3,17,"hey joe, while you’re over there how about another beer for the ross-a-tron?",
7,11,5,3,hey.,[entering]
7,11,5,6,"so i finally heard back from aunt sheryl and apparently it wasn’t a mistake. ahh, there’s-there’s limited seating in the hall.",
7,11,5,8,"well yeah, but she doesn’t know that. i mean, the last time she saw you-you would’ve turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling.",
7,11,5,10,"oh what’s the big deal?! i wasn’t even invited to the ceremony, just the reception. and-and y’know what? if it makes you feel any better, joan and i will just make an appearance and then, and then we’ll-we’ll leave early as a sign of protest.",

7,11,13,1,"oh, hey aunt millie.",
7,11,13,3,"yes, yes it is. it’s uh… every time on the lips! why?! why on lips?!",[aunt millie uses this opportunity to grab ross and kiss him on the lips. after she leaves ross quickly wipes his mouth with a napkin.] [cousin frannie and her husband enter.]
7,11,13,5,"now wait a minute, you be nice! all right? i didn’t bring you here so you can ambush her.",
7,11,13,7,that bitch!,[he gets up and they go over to ambush frannie. monica taps on frannie’s shoulder.]
7,11,13,10,"hi frannie, congratulations.",[to frannie]
7,11,13,13,so it’s really a question of who could you have possibly done.,
7,11,16,1,"what? oh, okay. wait here.","[goes to get it, but before he gets there aunt millie sits down on it forcing him to pull it out from behind her which gets her attention.]"
7,11,16,3,well…,
7,11,16,5,why?! why on the lips?!,"[he wipes his mouth on monica’s wrap and walks off, leaving aunt millie stunned.]"
7,12,1,1,"well, technically it seven billion years ago…","[well, technically you’d be able to see it for days, well nights; that is if you could see it with all of the bright lights of new york.]"
7,12,1,3,"okay! okay! fine, i’ll stop! no teaching, okay? we’ll just watch the pretty light streaking across the sky. okay? who’s official name is bapstein-king.","[comets don’t streak across the sky, meteors do.]"
7,12,1,12,"man, look at all those stars! infinite space. it really, really makes you wonder, doesn’t it?","[yeah, you can see what? five of them from the city?]"
7,12,1,14,huh?,

7,12,2,14,"joey come—i can’t believe—i bring you here to see the bapstein-king comet, one of nature’s most spectacular phenomenon, and all you care about are bugs stuck in tar and-and some woman!",
7,12,2,16,show me where?,
7,12,2,18,joey where’s the pipe that was holding the door open?,[noticing the pipe and looking at the door]
7,12,2,20,joey!,
7,12,2,22,"it’s called the bapstein-king comet, okay? hey! hey! bapstein was a very well respected astronomer!",[joey starts to groan.]

7,12,5,4,"yeah, i guess we don’t have a choice. help us! please help us! we’re stuck up on the roof and we can’t get down!!!",[standing at the edge of the roof] [screaming to the street]
7,12,5,6,"i know, i wasn’t finished. but don’t worry! we’re gonna go down the fire escape!!",[to joey] [joey motions him to finish.] [yelling at the street]
7,12,8,1,"ugh. well, we’re just gonna have to jump. yeah. now, we’re gonna have to make sure to land to the right of that patch of ice, okay? not hit the dumpster on the other side and uh, and try to avoid that-that weird brownish red stuff in the middle. so, when you get down there… you go up to the roof and you let me in.",[joey looks at him.]
7,12,8,3,"yeah! oh yeah, you’ll be fine! it-it’ll be uh, just like bungy jumping. y’know? but instead of bouncing back up you-you won’t.",
7,12,8,5,"well, i’m gonna lie to you joey, it’s a possibility.",
7,12,8,7,"oh, all right. tails! can you-can you see what it is?",[joey flips the coin.] [the coin bounces off of the landing above them and falls to the ground.]
7,12,8,9,"okay. well, you be careful.",
7,12,8,11,well i’m jumping! i have a son! okay? he won’t have a father if-if i die!,
7,12,14,1,"y’know, y’know i’m lookin’ and i don’t think anyone’s home here. i say we just break the window, crawl through, and-and y’know explain later.",[looking in the window behind them]
7,12,14,3,i don’t think so. hello? when you get in there…,"[knocks on the glass, which angers the big, large, angry dog behind the glass and causes them to jump to the other side of the landing.] [joey nods his disapproval.]"
7,12,19,0,"okay, do-do you have a good grip?",
7,12,19,2,"okay, i’m going to start climb down you now.",
7,12,19,4,okay. now-now-now should i climb down your front so we’re face to face or-or should i climb down your back so we’re-we’re butt to face.,

7,12,19,8,"okay, here i go.",
7,12,19,11,"i prefer not to answer that right now, i’m still carrying a little holiday weight.","[ross continues to climb down. he puts his other foot further down on joey’s torso, but that doesn’t work very well and he’s forced to wrap his legs around joey. which then forces joey to get a nice and close view of ross’s crotch.]"
7,12,19,13,so what do you want me to do?,
7,12,19,15,hi.,
7,12,19,17,m-maybe i should hang and you can climb down me.,[looking down]
7,12,19,19,it’s still looks pretty far!,
7,12,19,21,do not rush me!!,[ross continues south and his now wrapped around joey’s legs.]
7,12,19,23,"oww!! my ankle! i really hurt my ankle! i think i twisted it when i—ooh, a quarter!",
7,13,2,0,"hey, y’know what’s weird? after you guys get married, when you introduce me to people you’re gonna have to say, ""this is my brother-in-law ross."" not, ""my friend ross,"" ""brother-in-law ross."" that’s weird isn’t it?",
7,13,2,2,"sure, do whatever you want.",[disappointed] [phoebe sits down between chandler and ross.]
7,13,2,4,yeah?,
7,13,2,6,"oh, it looks like mom and dad’s house. oh, it even has a tree with a broken limb out front and the uh, the window in the attic is…oh my god!!",
7,13,2,9,i can’t believe they-they didn’t even tell us!,
7,13,2,11,"uh, hello dad! monica and i just saw the house in the paper! yes we’re surprised! who did you leave a message with?",[on phone] [listens] [listens]

7,13,7,11,"yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.",
7,13,7,14,"wow! great! wait, dad who-who’s cigarettes are these?",[finds a pack of cigarettes.]
7,13,7,16,"cool! dad! my report cards! hey, check this out dad, math, a. science, a. history, a. gym… oooh, my rock polisher!",[reading his grades] [he puts it away and finds something else.]
7,13,7,18,it’s a clown kit! clown kit!,
7,13,7,20,what?,
7,13,7,22,how are you ever going to sell this place?,
7,13,7,24,"oh no. dad! dad! what… oh god…everything’s ruined! dad, she’s gonna be crushed!",[he goes to open one of her boxes and it rips apart.]
7,13,7,26,no!,
7,13,11,1,"dad that won’t matter to her. look, all my stuff is safe and dry and all her is-is, is growing new stuff! see, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her.",
7,13,11,3,"well, can you blame her?",
7,13,11,5,"dad, dad i don’t want to hear about it.",
7,13,11,7,"well, not right now. okay look, monica came here for some memories and damnit, we’re gonna give her some! okay, grab…grab some empty boxes. okay? we’ll-we’ll take stuff from mine and whatever we can pass off as hers we’ll-we’ll put ‘em in their.",

7,13,11,13,"sure! ooh-ooh, what about this?",

7,13,14,4,"yeah! yeah! oh, this will make a great memory.",[overacting as well] [laughs.]
7,13,14,6,"well, these. these are yours right here.",[pointing to the boxes they just created for her.]
7,13,14,8,"yeah. yeah, oh you loved that thing. you always had it with you. you never went anywhere without-without that coloring book.",
7,13,14,10,nu-uh!,[grabs it and examines it.]

7,13,14,16,"umm, your boxes are umm…",
7,13,14,18,dad?,
7,13,17,1,all right. i think it was a mouse.,"[monica screams, throws the mouse down, and rubs her hands on ross’s sweater to clean them.]"

7,13,17,11,"well w-w-w-w-wait, w-wait, wait, wait a minute! i mean a couple of stupid boxes get wet and she gets a porsche ?!",

7,14,1,15,oh really. is that how you felt when you turned thirty?,[flashback to joey’s thirtieth birthday party. it is being held in monica and chandler’s apartment.]
7,14,1,18,"hey, 30 is not that old! do you know how old the earth is?",
7,14,4,4,hey! that was a practical purchase! i needed that car for transportation! okay? i-i have a child!,
7,14,5,0,"how hot do i look in this, huh?!",
7,14,5,2,that’s not what this is about okay? i-i am a sports car enthusiast. i have always been into cars.,
7,14,5,4,"i don’t know, but-but look how shiny!",[giddy]
7,14,5,8,"hop in. get ready for the smoothest ride of your life. anyway, this being new york he is parallel parked on a street with the car in front of him only inches ahead of his bumper, likewise with the car behind him. he’s completely boxed in and can’t move more than two inches. he tries to get out several times by bumping the bumpers of both cars to no avail.]","[phoebe hops in.] [he starts the car and surprisingly in fires right up and comes to a nice idle. [both can be rarities with british sports cars with their lovely lucas ignition systems, which tend not to work especially in the rain.]"
7,14,5,9,damnit!,[shuts the car off.]
7,14,7,0,"okay, forward. forward—stop! okay, back—stop! okay, forward—stop! stop! stop!",[the car moves an inch and ross runs to the back of the car.] [the car barely moves and ross runs back to the front.]
7,14,7,4,no-no-no! it’s mine! it’s-it’s mine.,[the woman walks away.]
7,14,9,17,maybe that will liven up this party.,

7,14,11,0,hey! look who’s back! it’s the birthday girl! how’s the birthday girl feeling?,
7,14,11,2,what?,"[glances over and sees the faces of the rest of the group, then goes and sits down.]"

7,14,12,1,you’re drunk! mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! maybe i’m a little drunk.,[to monica] [monica sits down on the barca lounger.]
7,14,12,6,i really wish that you wouldn’t.,

7,14,14,4,"all right everyone, lift! and slide!!","[they and try to lift the car, of course it doesn’t raise up] [everyone leans over, but the car still does not move.]"
7,14,15,30,"god, do you realize in ten years we’re gonna be 40?",
7,14,16,0,yes! my baby’s finally free!,
7,14,16,2,woohoo!,"[starting it] [just as they are about to pull away, a big, fat, bald guy pulls up in the exact same car as ross and stops next to him.]"
7,14,16,4,you wanna buy a car?,
7,15,1,2,what’s the matter? you okay?,
7,15,1,11,"okay. yeah, i guess, i guess i could do that too.",

7,15,1,45,"yeah-yeah, help me out here, when you come out of the ""brain transplant,"" you are going to be her?",
7,15,9,3,what?!,
7,15,9,5,"oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its scottish roots.",
7,15,9,7,well yeah-yeah the scottish history is so much more…,

7,15,9,17,"no, you’ve heard my practice. okay? just-just give me a chance to perform for you and then decide whatever you want. and i’m not going to tell you what song i’m gonna play either. but uh, let’s just say when it’s over i’ll bet there will be a we bit o’ celebration.",
7,15,13,0,…now remember you have to imagine me in a kilt.,
7,15,13,2,do you wanna start telling secrets?,[to rachel]
7,15,13,4,"now umm, remember i’m still learning.","[stands up] [as he prepares to start, he makes several horrible noises that scares rachel into retreat.]"
7,15,13,5,"one, two, three, four!","[he starts. and well, celebration was never meant to be played on the bagpipe, so even the best bag pipe players in the world would have trouble with that particular song. so of course, for a beginner like ross, it sounds absolutely dreadful. the assembled audience minus phoebe, are horrified. phoebe, immune to bad music, seems to enjoy it.]"
7,15,13,6,you know the song! sing along!,"[ross resumes playing, this time accompanied by phoebe screeching out e’s in tune with ross. while phoebe is singing along, rachel is having a very difficult time keeping a straight face. thankfully, ross gives up after a little while.]"

7,16,12,13,"wait! no! ben, come here! i am not kidding!",
7,16,12,15,i-i-am—,[suddenly ross starts screaming and comes falling down the stairs landing just in front of rachel.]
7,17,2,0,"well hello! she’s cute! should we uh, go try to talk to her?",[noticing a beautiful woman moving in down the street]
7,17,2,3,"uh yeah! let me, let me get that for you.",
7,17,2,5,"i got it. so hi, i’m uh, i’m ross and this is my friend chandler.",[exhales] [he lifts the box and grunts under the strain.] [calmly] [he shyly waves.]
7,17,2,7,"kristen, hi. are you uh, new to the area, ‘cause if you are…i’d love to show you around sometime.",
7,17,2,9,ah.,
7,17,2,11,"y’know actually it does have a very interesting history. uh, this street is the first street in the city to have an underground sewer system. before that sewage and waste would just flow right down the street. yeah, sometimes ankle deep!",[kristen crinkles her nose at that.] [he stops when he realizes what he’s talking about.]
7,17,2,14,"umm, say you’re gonna be starving after all this moving. what do you say i take you to dinner tonight?",

7,17,2,20,"oh no-no, after you. oh my god!",[she grabs a chair and heads upstairs.] [when she’s gone.] [he drops the box and chandler can’t pick it up.]
7,17,6,1,"laugh all you want but uh, she actually left me a message saying she’d like to go out again.",
7,17,6,3,"yeah in fact, i’m gonna go call her right now. and i’ll make sure to tell her my friend chandler says…",[he mimics the shy reaction chandler did.]
7,17,6,15,hey.,[returning]
7,17,6,17,oh great! we’re going out again saturday. but i just found she’s also seeing some other guy.,
7,17,6,20,well you shouldn’t be. believe me i wouldn’t want to be the guy who’s up against you. i mean that doofus is going to lose!,[chandler laughs.]
7,17,6,22,kristen lang.,

7,17,7,6,"okay, okay. this can go on for a while.",
7,17,7,8,"no joey! look why don’t, why don’t we just let her decide? okay? hey-hey, we’ll each go out with her one more time. and-and we’ll see who she likes best.",
7,17,7,10,maybe i’ll take her to that new french restaurant down the street…,
7,17,7,12,"well sorry, that’s what i do on dates.",

8,9,3,15,…co-founded. co-founded the club was because i was insanely in love with you. obviously i didn’t handle it very well. but if you think about it the i hate rachel club was really the i love rachel club.,

8,11,6,17,"i know! i know! why do you guys need to have this conversation?! huh? i mean no self-respecting man would ask a woman, ""so, where is this going?""",
8,11,6,19,"hey! you were a closed book! okay? i’m not a mind reader! besides, i hate those conversations. i’m horrible at them. really! maybe-maybe i need kind of a gesture. y’know, something that says we’re moving forward without having to talk about it.",

8,11,8,4,"i mean, there’s no point in spending time with someone if-if it’s just fun. it’s gotta be, it’s gotta be going somewhere right? so where-where is it going? ah! that’s-that’s the real question. and-and the answer is…is it’s going somewhere…fun. now i-i know what you’re thinking, fun was fine for you like ten years ago y’know, but you’re-you’re not getting any younger. no i mean—no not you, not you, you—you are getting younger. i mean—you-you look like you’re getting younger by the second—what’s your secret?",[pause]

8,12,5,0,"…which brings us back, of course, to greely’s theory of dominance. okay, that-that’s all for today. oh, uh does anyone know where the freeman building is?",[the bell rings.]

8,12,10,7,"you’ve seen it, the geller yeller.",
8,12,10,9,"besides, i-i think i figured out a much faster route, i’m sure i can make it this time. i just…i just can’t be afraid to get a little bit…hit by cars.",[he goes to the bathroom as joey enters.]
8,12,12,0,"yeah!!!! yes, i made it! i’m on time! okay, why don’t we all uh, open our books to page 23. where… where you will see…a uh…a bunch of uh…red spots. okay, umm, why don’t, why don’t you all start to read, while i—","[grabs a bottle of water from a student, takes a drink, and splashes some on his face like the marathon runners do.] [exhales loudly] [exhales again] [closes his book.] [passes out and collapses.]"

9,13,1,9,"why...why should i? i mean if she wants to move on, that's fine!",
9,13,1,11,"no i'm serious. i mean she wants to date people? fine! i don't care but...at least she could have told me. you know i...i've been putting my life on hold and just concentrating on emma but if she wants to go out there kissing guys she barely knows, then so will i ! very funny! ross is gay! ah! ah!",
9,13,1,13,"i don't know. i mean i have plenty of opportunity. just just now there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me. and then the other day on the subway a woman ""accidentally"" sat on my hand.",

9,13,4,11,you know what? enough! enough talking! i have to get moving! hey check out those two blondes over there! hey come with me!,
9,13,4,13,"you don't have to do anything. it will just be easier if it is the two of us, like college, remember? you...you break the ice with some kind of jokes so that they know you're the funny one and i swoop in with some interesting conversation, so they'll see that i'm the brilliant, brooding, sexy one...",
9,13,4,15,don't you have to be at work?,
9,13,4,17,"hum...so...hum...oh hey i noticed you were reading the paper...another flood in europe? here’s a question ""would you... would you rather drown or be burnt alive?""",

9,13,7,2,"right, so that's a firm ""no"". i cannot believe this, i just keep striking out.",
9,13,7,4,this is great. rachel's gonna keep kissing guys until she finds the one she wants and i'm gonna die alone.,

9,13,11,11,"oh, just this woman i’ve been seeing.",
9,13,11,13,"yeah, didn’t i mention that? yeah, i mean, we haven’t being going out for too long, but rather there is this amazing connection between us. i-i mean, in fact just before you came in she called me her boyfriend. i thought it was a little too soon, but it was also, you know, it was kinda nice.",
9,13,11,15,"how great is this? you are already comfortable enough to look through my stuff. oh, i am sorry michelle, that’s my roommate, rachel.",
9,13,11,18,i told you about my daughter.,

9,13,14,12,"through the magic of sight! i was here, putting our child to sleep...",
9,13,14,14,"when i happened to look through the window and i see you kissing a guy you know, for what? a week?",
9,13,14,17,"ok, michelle, it’s time to go.",
9,13,14,19,ok.,
9,13,14,21,"you know, if it’s meant to be, i’ll guess it. bye, bye.",

9,13,14,25,"oh, really!",
9,13,14,27,"oh, really!",
9,13,14,29,what about the guy from the bar?,
9,13,14,31,the guy you gave your number to.,
9,13,14,33,"because he called here looking for you. so don’t tell me this...this kissing this guy from work is a one time thing, ok? you’ve been out there in bars and on balconies for over a month now. and you didn’t even have the courtesy to tell me.",
9,13,14,35,what?,
9,13,14,37,because i folded it up and put in my pants pocket. do you...do you not look there?,
9,13,14,39,i never gave it to you.,
9,13,14,41,i don’t know.,
9,13,14,43,who am i?,
9,13,14,45,i am the guy who’s taking care of our baby while you’re out at bars meeting guys!,
9,13,14,47,none of the sane ones wanted to come back with me! that’s not the point. ok? the point is you...you are the one who moved on and didn’t tell anyone!,
9,13,14,49,"uh, clearly.",
9,13,14,51,"yeah, maybe not. so what you wanna do?",
9,14,1,5,"hey, you're not naked! so hey, rach, when will we expect to see you tonight?",

9,14,1,15,"i'm, i'm okay.",
9,14,1,17,"sure, i mean, do i wish me and rachel living together would have worked out? of course. you know, i'm disappointed, but it's not like it's a divorce.",
9,14,1,19,"no, it's not a divorce, it is not a divorce! anyway, i think rachel and i need to, you know, get on with our lives, maybe, maybe start seeing other people.",
9,14,1,21,"yeah, sure, why not? in fact, if you know anyone that would be good for me...",
9,14,1,23,yeah? any names come to mind?,
9,14,6,0,"excuse me, is there a woman waiting at the bar? someone average height, dark hair, perhaps doing a puzzle?",
9,14,6,2,"well, if i'm still here in an hour, buy him a drink on me.",
9,14,6,4,"nah, i don't know if i should. i don't wanna be drunk when i go home alone.",

9,14,14,13,"i did, too.",
9,14,14,15,but is it technically a date if the other person doesn't show up?,

9,14,14,19,that bad?,
9,14,14,21,female body inspector? what size is that?,[cut to outside. phoebe and joey are walking down the street to central perk.]

9,14,15,1,"i know. a double blind date, and we both get stood up. what are the chances?",
9,15,1,10,"so, uh, what kinda stuff do you think they'll have you do there?",
9,15,1,15,"you know, if i didn't already have a job, i think, i would have been really good in advertising.",
9,15,1,17,"yes, i did , i did ! i should have written it down!","[ he turns to joey, disappointed ]"

9,15,7,19,"yeah, it was pretty traumatic. i was outside st. marc's comics… you know, i-i-i was just there minding my own business, you know, seeing what kinda trouble spiderman got into that week-",
9,15,7,21,"anyway, i was heading towards this bakery, you know, to pick up a couple of dozen linzer torts for someone… … when outta nowhere this thug with a pipe jumps out and says ""gimme your money, punk!""",[ he looks at monica ]
9,15,7,23,"i know! and-and the worst part was they took my backpack which had all the original artwork i had done for my own comic book ""science boy""",

9,16,9,15,"if you have to call me name, i prefer ""ross the divorcer"". it's just cooler. look, i know my marriage isn't exactly work out. but i love to be that committed to another person. and carol had some good times before she became a lesbian... and once afterward. i'm sorry.",

9,23,16,4,"and that's just the herbivores. i'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores, their heads are already too big. which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development.",[all the paleontologists laugh]
9,23,16,6,"but all kidding aside, in much the same way that homo ergaster is now thought to be a separate species from homo erectus...",[1] [joey laughs]
9,23,16,11,... and while there are certainly vast differences between these mesozoic fossiles and the example of homo erectus...,[rachel laughs]
9,23,17,0,... in a very real way we can bring the mesozoic era into the 21st century. thank you!,[concluding his speech] [pauses] [everybody stands up and applauds. ross looks flattered and surprised. his friends and other members of the audience go to congratulate him]

9,23,26,1,hi.,
9,23,26,3,"yeah. the bartender said that they split up into two search parties, the herbivores and the carnivores. you know, we as a group are not the coolest.",[pause] [three paleontologists walk by and ross hugs charlie trying not to be seen]

9,23,26,7,oh. can i... can i ask who?,[apparently unruffled]
9,23,26,9,"i think i know too but i've been really wrong about this stuff in the past, so...","[charlie kisses ross, they stop for a moment and then he kisses her back]"
9,23,26,10,i'm sorry... we... we can't.,
9,23,26,12,"i mean, you just went out with my best friend, and i just think it'd be a really really bad idea. or-or not!","[pause] [they kiss passionately] [joey walks in and sees ross and charlie kissing. he gives a faint, rueful smile, then he seems to recollect something and suddenly he moves back to rachel's room. he knocks on her door and she opens]"

10,5,10,64,no more falafel for you!,"[pointing at amy, shouting] [amy looks at ross, angrily. rachel clearly doesn't understand what he meant and looks at ross who gestures ""later"".]"

10,6,16,4,"yeah. he wouldn't give me the grant, because i wouldn't give you up.",
10,6,16,6,"really? is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review, who was the voice of ""underdog""?",
10,6,16,8,"if you don't believe me, let's go talk to him, okay? i'm telling you, he didn't ask me one paleontological question.",
10,6,16,10,"oh, i'm sorry, no. he did ask me one. uhm... how do you spell mboscodictiosaur?",

10,7,4,20,"space is filled with orbiting children. look, please, just come on, you know, when you’ll see the look on emma’s face, i swear you won’t regret it.",[pause]
10,7,4,22,"good, you don’t want to be one of those mothers who pass on their irrational fears on their children, do you?",
10,7,4,24,"oh, yeah, that’s the same, i am sure there are thirty different species of poisonous swings!",
10,7,6,1,ok.,

10,7,15,3,"this feels perfectly normal. ok, get on the swing!",[gasps and speaks at a higher pitch]
10,7,15,7,see?,

10,7,15,11,well... whaa... aaah... aaahhh...,"[realizes, screaming like a little girl, trying to get rid of the spider] [ross is now preoccupied with the spider, and forgets that rachel is still using the swing. while trying to get rid of the spider, he stands in front of rachel, who bumps into him, throwing him on the ground again.]"
10,8,1,7,are you kidding?,
10,8,1,9,that doesn't sound like you... that's monica talking!,[skeptical]

10,9,5,16,"uh, actually these might look pretty good on me.",

10,9,8,0,so? what do you think?,[to joey] [shows himself - joey observes him with a strange look on his face.]
10,9,8,2,yeah! yeah! rachel picked it out for me. she told me to trust her and you know what? i'm glad i did! i turned quite a few heads on my way over here.,[not getting it]
10,9,8,4,"oh, i see, somebody is afraid of a little competition with the ladies?",
10,9,8,6,"you're just jealous because you couldn't pull this off. yeah, now if you'll excuse me i have a date. see? all eyes on me!","[getting up and taking his coat] [as he is walking out, everyone turns and stares at him] [to joey]"
10,9,11,1,"oh! you are gonna love it! and i'm so glad, we're finally doing this.","[the girl is looking in the other direction as ross is taking off his own coat, revealing the pink and white ladies shirt]"
10,9,11,3,here so this was fun!,"[gets behind her to help. when the coat comes off we see she is wearing the exact same shirt ross is wearing. they look at each other, shocked. they abruptly put their coat back on] [they leave the room and head into opposite directions]"

10,10,4,7,"no one, i’m just saying if...",[phoebe starts pinching him in his neck]
10,10,4,9,"i know nothing! mike’s a great guy, it was hypothetical!",[yelling in pain]
10,10,4,11,"believe me, if i did see with someone, there’s no way i...",[phoebe starts pinching him again]
10,10,5,6,we think chandler might be having an affair.,

10,10,5,29,oh my god.,
10,10,5,34,so you wanna buy a house in the 50's?,[sarcastic]
10,10,5,36,"you know what, if you wanna look for a house, that's okay.",
10,10,5,38,"it's ok, because they have to get it out of their system, okay , but you're going to realize, this is the only place, you wanna be.","[to joey] [back to mon and chan] [pause before monica and chandler speak, they look like they are looking for the right words]"
