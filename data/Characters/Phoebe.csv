5,14,3,18,no! you don't have to do anything! just don't tell them that we know!,
5,14,3,24,"well, you could use your position y'know as the roommate.",

5,14,9,7,"oh absolutely. shall we say, around seven?",
5,14,9,9,good. i'm really looking forward to you and me having sexual intercourse.,"[as she walks away, chandler mouths a scream to monica. how motions and mouths, ""it's okay, it's okay.""]"
5,14,10,1,"okay, rachel, get me perfume!",
5,14,10,3,"and joey, get me a bottle of wine and glasses?","[he begrudgingly does so.] [in the meantime, rachel has returned with the perfume and sprays a mist out in front of phoebe who walks through the mist and does a little spin.] [cut to chandler, joey, and ross's, monica is getting chandler ready for his half of the plan.]"
5,14,10,12,okay.,

5,14,10,24,"no, i want this to happen.",
5,14,10,27,"maybe, maybe i'll dance for you.",[she starts doing a rather suggestive and seductive dance that's silly at the same time.]
5,14,10,29,"thanks! y'know, that when you say things like that it makes me wanna rip that sweater vest right off!",
5,14,10,31,really?,
5,14,10,33,"no. no! it's just y'know first, i wanna take off all my clothes and have you rub lotion on me.",

5,14,10,56,here it comes. our first kiss.,[they slowly and hesitantly move their lips together and kiss gently. phoebe has her eyes wide open in shock and chandler is squinting. he finally breaks the kiss after only a short while and pushes phoebe away.]
5,14,10,58,and why not?!,
5,14,10,60,you're-you're what?!,"[monica comes out of the bathroom like a bolt, and rachel and joey both enter.]"

5,15,10,7,"oh, i was telling them about you and emily. y'know, try to get some sympathy.",
5,15,10,9,but somehow you came off as the bad guy.,
5,15,10,11,"yeah, i think i told it wrong. y'know, we should talk about that because i don't totally understand what happened there.",
5,15,10,13,"oh, okay, see? things are looking up already!",
5,15,10,21,"all right, everyone calm down! everyone calm down! i have something that i would like to say! who here likes ross? of course you don't like him! he-he didn't give you any money, he raised his own hand when i asked, ""who hear likes ross,"" and he's wearing two nametags! i-i'll be honest with you guys, when i first met ross i didn't like him at all! but then once i got to know him i saw that he's really sweet and caring and very generous. i mean, all i'm saying is don't judge ross before you get to know him all right? i mean, i like all you guys now, but when i first meet you y'know kurt, i thought, y'know abrasive drunk, umm lola, mind numbingly stupid! and okay, you guys gold-digger, cradle robbing perv! so, i think you all know what i mean.","[ross is the only one who raises his hand and phoebe glares at him to put his hand back down.] [he takes one off.] [she turns to an elderly gentleman and a 20 something woman, who're a couple.] [to the girl] [to the old guy]"
5,15,11,0,"obviously i didn't think they were gonna start throwing things. i just thought if i kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero.",
5,15,13,4,"aw, and i was gonna ask you to marry me because i forgot to say hello to you last week.",
5,16,3,1,all right. hold on. i got it. nickel! how much more do we need?,[she starts digging in the chair.] [donates it.]
5,16,3,3,"okay, dime! you guys should probably keep talking; this could take a while. oh no, wait! look it! whoa! oh my god, this is a police badge!",[donates that.] [finds something else.] [looks at it.]
5,16,3,7,"yeah, i should probably take it back. ooh, but you know what? while i'm at the police station, i could check their ten most wanted lists because my friend fritzy has been like number 11 forever, so this could be her year!",[she crosses her fingers in hope.]
5,16,5,0,"oh. oh! ma'am? excuse me, ma'am?",

5,16,7,4,"you could get arrested, right now! all right, yeah, i gotta take it back. i'm totally drunk with power.",[flashes the badge and they glare at her.] [she heads for the door just as joey enters.]
5,16,7,5,hey.,[to joey]
5,16,8,0,"excuse me, is this your car?",
5,16,8,2,"well i don't think it's very nice of you to park here, y'know you're blocking the entrance.",
5,16,8,4,"well, it's a problem for me, which means it's a problem for you 'cause i'm a cop.",[shows the badge.]
5,16,8,6,"ohh, no. oh okay, so you're a cop which means you can park anywhere, 'cause i know that 'cause i'm a cop too. so, all right, keep up the good work. 10-4.",[pause] [tries to leave.]

5,16,8,18,"i-i sure will, take care.",[starts walking off.]
5,16,8,20,oh.,[she starts laughing. then she throws the badge at him and runs away.]
5,16,12,8,"ooh, god, it's him! it's that cop! god, i can't believe it! he found me!",
5,16,12,10,"well, if i'm going down, i'm taking you with me. harboring a fugitive? that's one to three years minimum. good luck chandler. okay, you can arrest me. fine. but you'll never make it stick and you know it!",[points at all of them] [they all look at her.] [she opens the door to the cop from before.]
5,16,12,12,yep! as long as you understand that i'm going to call my lawyer and once he puts you on the stand he'll make you look like a fool. a fool!,
5,16,12,14,i would love it if i weren't here!,

5,17,1,17,okay. oh my god! what did i ever do to you?!,[they shake hands and she pulls away suddenly] [rubbing her hand.]
5,17,1,19,"let's just say, i'm glad i'm not chandler.",[chandler tries to comprehend that remark.]
5,17,5,2,but it's just so unfair that our date has to get cut short just 'cause some guy shot at a store clerk.,
5,17,5,4,"okay, then maybe i can come too!",
5,17,5,6,"all right, you go.",[they kiss.]
5,17,5,8,"'kay, bye!",[gary closes the door behind him.]

5,21,1,28,i don't know. i'll just handle it—i'll ask you to talk to him!,
5,21,1,30,"because you are so afraid of commitment! you talk to him, make him scared like you! make him a…man!",
5,21,5,1,"hmm, did you talk to gary about the moving in thing?",

5,21,6,38,"i couldn't tell him no. he got so sad. maybe it'll be all right. i do really like him a lot and probably do it eventually anyway and plus, think of all the money i'll save on stamps.",
5,21,6,40,"no, i just heard when people live together, they split the cost of stamps. don't they?",

6,2,3,22,"ross, you’re being ridiculous! okay? you are cute and smart and sweet and that is much more important than three stupid divorces!",
6,2,3,24,"y’know that’s really fair. y’know? most guys who have been divorced three times are like 60. ross, nobody cares about this except you! this-this embarrassment thing is all in your head! here, i’ll show you! come here.",
6,2,3,26,"hi! hi! listen, my friend ross is about to be divorced for the third time, but wouldn’t you date him?",[to the girls]
6,2,5,1,"okay, so what do you think ladies? who wouldn’t be interested? who wouldn’t want to date him?",
6,2,5,3,"okay, what about you? wouldn’t you want a date?",[points to karin]
6,2,5,5,whatever! what about you meg?,[interrupting]
6,2,5,8,"she said, ""he’s obviously still in love with this rachel girl.""",[leaning to him] [he glares at her.]
6,2,5,10,"well, i thought you loved her when you-when you married her.",
6,2,5,12,hey! you could do a lot worse than joey tribbiani!!,
6,2,5,14,"yes, and now he’s using this three divorces reason because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her. i must say, ""well done!"" bravo meg.",
6,2,10,0,"okay, bye!",[to joey and chandler]
6,2,10,2,so? did you get the annulment?,
6,2,10,4,i knew it! because you love rachel.,
6,2,10,6,"yeah, complicated ‘cause of the love.",
6,2,10,8,i’ve never been more convinced of your love for her.,
6,2,12,1,"oh we do, but not just yet.",
6,2,12,3,"okay umm, well, first chandler and monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way. yeah. but it won’t work out.",
6,2,12,5,"i know. then, i’m gonna marry chandler for the money and you’ll marry rachel and have the beautiful kids.",
6,2,12,7,but then we ditch those two and that’s when we get married. we’ll have chandler’s money and rachel’s kids and getting custody will be easy because of rachel’s drinking problem.,
6,2,12,9,"i don’t want to go into the whole thing, but umm, we have words and i kill him.",
6,3,1,1,hey! check it out! this is unbelievable! joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!,"[we see joey who has puffed up his cheeks and chandler nonchalantly reaches down and pinches joey’s nose shut. in a few seconds, joey has to move because he’s now forced to actually hold his breath.]"
6,3,1,4,"uh-huh, what?",
6,3,1,6,oh!,
6,3,1,8,"well, that would be great but then what do we do about denise?",
6,3,1,10,my roommate.,
6,3,1,12,"yes, denise. denise!",
6,3,1,15,maybe because you never listen to anything that i say. i talk about her all the time! denise!!!!!,
6,3,2,0,hey.,
6,3,2,2,"so, what did rachel say when you told her you were still married to her?",
6,3,2,4,you didn’t tell her did you?,
6,3,2,6,"of course not, because you’re in love with her.",
6,3,2,8,"what do you mean, comforted her?",
6,3,2,10,"ah-ha! a classic sign of love, the hug!",
6,3,2,12,"yeah, not in your case lovey loverson.",[tries to take a bite out of ross’s cookie.]
6,3,2,14,"okay, just tell me this, did you or did you not smell her hair?",
6,3,2,16,"ninety percent of a women’s pheromones come out the top of her head! that’s why, that’s why women are shorter. so that men will fall in love when they hug them! oh come on ross, you’re a scientist.",[ross is staring at her dumbfounded.]
6,3,2,18,"okay, whatever you say. but just be careful, all right? rachel’s not in the same place you are.",[taking his coffee]
6,3,2,20,"okay, i didn’t understand that, but y’know, maybe that’s ‘cause you were speaking the secret language of love!","[she goes for his magazine and he grabs it away before she reaches it. but she was only using the magazine as a decoy because she grabs his cookie and coffee, takes a bite out of the cookie and drinks some of the coffee.]"
6,3,5,1,shhhhhh! i’m swamped right now.,
6,3,5,3,"umm, i’m trying to move that pencil.",[there’s a pencil lying on the table.]
6,3,5,5,it worked!,
6,3,5,7,"wait, no, look at this! ""two bedroom, two bath, must be non-smoker, satan worshipers okay…"" oh, yeah, but it’s on the ground floor.",[points to one.] [reading]
6,3,5,17,i saw it.,
6,3,5,19,"umm, i’m talking about that which you already know but won’t admit. you love her again; you re-love her!",
6,3,5,21,"i can’t believe you won’t just admit it! okay, just promise me that you won’t do anything stupid.",[pause]
6,3,5,26,what?!,
6,3,6,4,"wow! i’m-i’m so happy for you guys. this is so-so, not stupid.",[to ross]
6,3,6,9,"no. no, i won’t. but i should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate denise. she moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didn’t love her, but he really did, and it just blew up! and that’s how she ended up living with me! okay, that’s a lie.",[ross looks at her.] [pause]
6,3,13,0,"i found you in my bed! how’d you whined up there? you are a mystery! little black curly hair! little black curly hair! little black, little black, little black, little black, little black curly hair…………",[singing] [applause.]
6,3,13,1,"now if you want to receive e-mails about my upcoming shows, then please give me money so i can buy a computer.",
6,3,13,19,yes.,"[on the microphone, accidentally] [rachel enters.]"
6,4,1,8,"ross, i know what you’re thinking.",
6,4,1,10,"that she’s gonna move in with you and maybe then she’ll fall in love with you and then when she finds out you’re already married, she’ll just be happy. y’know? you’re just, you’re very sad.",
6,4,1,12,what?!!,
6,4,1,14,no!,[ross’s phone rings.]
6,4,1,26,"yeah, professor and mrs.",
6,4,1,28,"oh! yeah, y’know you and ross are still married.",
6,4,1,30,just kidding!,
6,4,1,32,saved your ass.,[to ross]
6,4,2,1,hi.,
6,4,2,4,"well, you know that psychic i see?",
6,4,2,6,"well, she told me that i’m gonna die this week, so i’m kinda bummed about that.",
6,4,2,8,"yeah, and i know you guys don’t know a lot about psychic readings, but that one is pretty much the worse one you can get.",
6,4,2,12,i don’t—she said y’know that i’d have triplets! but she also said one of them would be black.,
6,4,2,14,"no, ‘cause she didn’t tell me i was gonna die until the very end of the session, and i was not gonna waste a whole another hour there! i mean i’ve only got a week left, y’know? i’ve really gotta start living now! , leans back, and starts reading.]",[so she picks up the latest copy of car and driver [a u.s. auto magazine]
6,4,2,20,"oh, this is it. this what’s gonna kill me.",
6,4,4,0,hey!,
6,4,4,2,"ugh, it’s so exhausting waiting for death. ohh, by the way, do you think you could—","[groans, hacks, and then freezes with her eyes open and her tongue hanging out.]"
6,4,4,4,i was preparing you for my—didn’t you think i was dead? did that not come off?,
6,4,4,6,"yeah, thanks. and listen, can you do me a favor? could you just umm, wake me up in a couple hours, y’know if you can.",[phoebe goes and lies down as rachel opens the drawer monica hid the candlesticks in and as monica walks out of her room.]
6,4,9,4,hey!,
6,4,9,7,what’s going on?,
6,4,9,10,hey! maybe you’ll die!,
6,4,9,12,"no, we can go together! just don’t wait too long though, okay? ‘cause i’m outta here sometime before friday.",
6,4,9,14,"no-no, it’ll be fun! we can come back and we can haunt these guys!",
6,4,14,4,hey!,[entering]
6,4,14,6,"listen to this! my reading was wrong, i’m not going die!",
6,4,14,8,because my psychic is dead! she must’ve read the cards wrong!,
6,4,14,10,"eh, better her than me! hey, let’s bake cookies!",
6,4,18,0,have you really done this before?,
6,4,18,2,hey!,
6,4,18,5,we’re just celebrating that joey got his health insurance back.,

6,5,1,10,"okay, this is inexcusable. i am shocked to my very core!",
6,5,1,12,another lie. you have a sickness!,
6,5,2,8,"oh, good, good, you guys are here! listen, how would like to spend tomorrow taking care of three incredibly cute little puppies?!",[coming in from the bathroom]

6,5,2,13,please! please! please! please! oh please! please! please! frank and alice asked me to baby sit the triplets and i’m nervous ‘cause i’ve never done that before by myself!,[stops]
6,5,4,1,"what about me? i just found out that denise is leaving town for a while, i don’t have a roommate.",
6,5,4,3,maybe you could be my roommate!,
6,5,4,5,yeah!,
6,5,4,7,"umm, she said she’d be back december 26 th",
6,5,5,1,i’m doing okay. i think it’s going well. do you think they’re having fun? am i talking to fast?,[rapidly]
6,5,5,4,"na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.",
6,5,5,8,"that sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping.",
6,5,5,11,yeah? well this is not what i ordered.,[checking the final diaper]
6,5,5,14,hey!,
6,5,7,0,i don’t know why i was so nervous about this. and i don’t know why frank and alice are always complaining. this is so easy.,
6,5,7,5,"no chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! and also, look at his smooth area, that’s just gonna mess them up.",
6,5,7,7,what?!,
6,5,7,9,"oh, look at little leslie stretching in her sleep.",
6,5,7,11,"oh, i can still do that.",

6,5,9,14,but you-you can’t leave me with them! we-we’re a team! we’re playing a zone! they’re gonna triple team me!,
6,5,9,16,"but no, because a doctor won’t be able to help him, it’s just gonna y’know naturally pass through his system in like seven years.",
6,5,9,18,i’m pretty sure it’s gun.,
6,5,9,20,"a real man wouldn’t just run to the hospital! no! what would, what would krog do?",[they don’t stop.] [they ignore her and phoebe is left alone.]
6,5,11,0,"me taking care of you is no problem, huh? you guys feel safe. right? okay, i’m gonna take that spit bubble as, ""yeah, i do!"" okay, after i get rid of this dirty diaper leslie, i’ll set you up with a clean one. okay, i’m sorry. i didn’t mean to scare you. i just have to clean that up. okay? ‘cause let’s face it, we’re at monica’s. i broke it. all right. well, that’s just the way that goes. okay, good. why are there only two of you? where is leslie? well, you can’t answer. leslie? where are you leslie? leslie, now would be a good time for your first words! well, look at you! hey! you are a little bit mischievous! my gosh! oh, you’re a lot mischievous! well, it’ll dry. okay, you sit with your brother and sister now—who aren’t there!","[she throws it at the garbage without looking, misses, and knocks over a vase and flowers, which fall to the floor and break.] [she crawls over, disposes of the diaper, picks up the flowers, and the vase.] [she throws out both the flowers and the vase.] [she turns around and only counts two babies.] [she starts looking for her] [she turns around and finds that leslie has managed to crawl into the bottom drawer of the tv cabinet.] [she picks her up and notices a surprise is waiting in the drawer.] [closes the drawer with her foot.] [to leslie] [they both have disappeared as well.] [time lapse, the babies are finally asleep. good for phoebe! the only problem is, monica’s apartment looks like a tornado, a hurricane, a swarm of locusts, fire, brimstone, hail, and giant man-eating, radioactive ants have torn the place apart. needless to say, it’s messy enough to cause monica to die of shock right away. parents with small children know what i’m talking about.]"
6,5,11,2,how do you feel?,[exhausted]
6,5,11,4,"okay, so i totally took care of the babies all by myself! i fed ‘em, bathed ‘em, and put ‘em to bed.",

6,6,4,5,"you guys, we said we were gonna have fun! come on, hey, remember the time… you don’t remember?",[she starts laughing hysterically.]
6,6,4,8,"well, this doesn’t have to be so sad though. y’know? maybe instead of just thinking about how much you’re gonna miss each other, you should like think of the things you’re not gonna miss.",
6,6,4,10,"come on, there’s gotta be something.",
6,6,4,13,good! great! you can go first.,
6,6,4,15,"good that’s a good one. okay, monica, anything? y’know? does rachel move the phone pen?",

6,6,9,3,"i know, i took it hard too.",[monica goes into rachel’s room.]
6,6,9,13,"hey, how are you guys doing?",
6,6,9,17,"okay, you guys. you guys i think i know what’s going on here. okay, you guys… stop!! i know that, i know that you’re acting mad because you think that it’ll make it easier to leave. but deep down you’re still really sad. deep-deep down.",[they stop.]
6,6,9,19,"well, deep-deep-deep down!",
6,6,9,21,then keep running.,[they resume the chase.]
6,6,11,2,"hey you guys, i don’t mean to make things worse, but umm, i don’t want to live with rachel anymore. monica and",

6,7,10,13,"well, i didn't get embarrassed running next to miss . but no, okay. no, no, i can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you. yeah, okay. you're uptight.",[panting]
6,7,10,15,"that's okay rachel. i'm not judging you; that's just who you are. me. i'm more free y'know? i run like i did when i was a kid, cause that's the only way it's fun. y'know, i mean didn’t you ever run so fast you thought your legs were gonna fall off? y'know, like when you were like running towards the swings or running away from satan? the neighbor's dog.",[rachel looks confused]
6,7,13,1,hey!,
6,7,13,3,"see? and you don't care if people are staring, it's just for a second cause then you're gone!",

6,8,6,30,"hey. here. ohh, who’s the silver fox?",[hands chandler a copy of her flyer and sees the picture of ralph.]
6,8,6,32,that’s not ralph lauren. sounds like him though.,
6,8,6,34,"yeah, no, ralph doesn’t look anything like that guy. he’s-he’s young and he’s got long hair and a beard and a hacky sack.",

6,9,3,78,"okay, look at him. look at those strong hands. oh what i wouldn’t give to be that can of condensed milk.",[looks closer to see what jack is drinking] [we see a shot of jack drinking condensed milk on the couch.] [ross and judy enter the living room. judy and ross sit down on the couch beside jack. monica and chandler are sitting on the coffee table.]
6,9,6,1,"monica, leave him alone !",[monica gives phoebe a surprised expression and goes over to ross and chandler.]
6,9,7,26,"so, now, rach, this is a traditional english trifle, isn’t it?",

6,9,7,55,"i dunno, let’s see! so, okay, i dreamt that we were gonna get married, and he left, becuz he had to go fight a fire. and, um, so okay, i went to a night club, and i saw him making out with a girl.",
6,9,7,57,"yeah, but then jacques cousteau came and he kicked his ass for betraying me! it was soo cool! then, he took me diving and he introduced me to his pet seahorse, who, by the way, was totally coming on to me, and please, that is not gonna happen.",[jack and judy come out of monica’s room and sit down on the couch.]

7,2,11,18,he said you poked at him with wooden spoons.,
7,2,11,20,"well, he’s never coming back! okay? you just cost me eight dollars a week!",
7,2,11,22,"oh, it’s my fault?! you didn’t have to massage him! you could’ve sent him away! you could’ve not rolled tonka trucks up and down his back!",
7,3,2,0,so what do you guys want for an engagement present?,
7,3,2,5,not unless someone borrowed it and left it at the gynecologist.,
7,3,2,10,you mean the chocolate chip cookie recipe?,

7,3,2,15,"break my heart—oh, all right.",
7,3,2,23,"if you don’t sail your boat, what do you do on it?",

7,3,3,23,"because i’m normal! that was the one legacy my grandmother left me, and i know you wanted it as an engagement present.",[pauses as he figures out how to answer that]
7,3,3,27,"okay, here i wish you health and happiness.",[she hands monica a cookie in a plastic baggie.]

7,3,8,6,"yeah, but not as good as batch 17.",
7,3,8,10,are there anymore from the good batch? ‘cause we could just work off of those.,
7,3,10,0,"y’know, i bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to know that we’re trying to figure out her recipe. i bet she’s l-l-lookin’ up at us and smiling right now.",
7,3,10,2,"oh yeah—no, she was really nice to me, but she’s in hell for sure.",

7,8,7,49,it's a thanksgiving miracle!,
7,8,7,51,"yeah, she came all the way back from ross' building. oh, the things she must have seen! and then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window with her teeny little paw and then we ran to let her in… i went to far, didn't i? when should i have stopped?","[realizes, that chandler starts to not believing her] [time lapse, after dinner. ross stands up from his self-made map.]"
7,9,1,8,"his first big kid’s bike, this is so exciting!",
7,9,1,11,i never had a bike of my own.,
7,9,1,13,"well, we didn’t have a lot of money. but the girl across the street had the best bike! it was pink and it had rainbow colored tassels hanging off the handle grips, and-and-and a bell and this big , white wicker basket with those plastic daisies stuck on.",
7,9,1,17,no! but she gave me the box that it came in. it had a picture of the bike on the front. so i would sit on it and my step-dad would drag me around the backyard.,[they’re all speechless]
7,9,1,19,"not really, i got to drag him around too!","[they all nod, ""oh.""]"
7,9,4,6,"yeah, and they’ve been coming by all day. they love it!",

7,9,7,13,of course!,
7,9,7,15,okay. see? commercial break,"[the gang is giggles then phoebe gets the bike out of the rack, gets on, pushes off, rolls a few feet, and falls over.]"
7,9,9,1,"wait! this seat is really uncomfortable! yeah, maybe before we start we should just get another one. perhaps, like an airplane seat—or a beanbag chair!",[hopping off the bike]
7,9,9,3,why? why do i have to learn?,
7,9,9,5,what kind of an emergency?,
7,9,9,7,"okay, i would ring the bell to distract him and then i would knock the gun out of his hand with a chinese throwing star.",
7,9,9,9,you won’t let go?,
7,9,9,11,swear?!,
7,9,9,13,okay.,[thinks it over]

7,9,9,27,i am shocked! shocked!!,[she storms off leaving ross to defend himself from the angry looks from onlookers.]
7,9,10,5,"oh, hello liar.",[seeing him]
7,9,10,7,i could’ve been killed i hope you know!,
7,9,10,9,"well, i would love to but…the bike got stolen and the police have no suspects.",[ross just happens to have his hand on a sheet that is covering something that suspiciously looks like a bike.]
7,9,10,11,what?! what the hell?!,[ross rings the bell.]
7,9,10,13,what?! why?!,
7,9,10,15,"all right. if you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.",
7,9,10,17,okay ross! please don’t die!,[sarcastically] [ross exits and she says quietly to the bike]
7,9,13,0,i can’t believe it! i did it! i rode a bike! i never thought i’d be able to do that! thank you ross.,
7,9,13,2,"don’t be so corny ross, it’s not an after-school special.","[she rides off and the camera pans down to reveal two shiny, silver training wheels firmly attached.]"
7,10,1,3,hey!,[entering carrying a skull]
7,10,1,6,haaaa... ... ahhhh!,[puts the skull on the table]
7,10,1,8,huh?,
7,10,1,10,"oh, yeah, it's my mom's.",
7,10,1,12,"no, no, no. it's not! it's not my mom. it belonged to mom. yeah, no, she used to put it out every christmas to remind us, that even though it's christmas, people still die. and, you can put candy in it.","[she grabs the skull, pulls out a stick of licorice, and takes a bite.]"
7,10,1,20,and maybe i could teach ben about the christmas skull and how people die.,
7,10,2,4,"oh, hey, you guys!",[entering]
7,10,2,7,"hey. guess what! my landlord just called and my apartment is gonna get ready soon, so i guess i'll be moving out.",
7,10,2,9,"yes, you will be very sad. all right, well i gotta go tell rachel the good news.",
7,10,2,11,"yeah, why not?",
7,10,2,13,"why do you think, she's having so much fun living with joey?",
7,10,2,15,"really? so she said, she didn’t wanna live with me anymore?",
7,10,2,18,you're sure? you're absolutely sure?,
7,10,2,20,"probably? yeah, i don't like that word. kind of what ‘probably’ really means. yeah, uh-huh. yeah, oh, ""your mom probably won't kill herself,"" y’know? i'm sorry, but i'm not hanging all my hopes of rachel and i living together on-on ""probably!"" y’know? you gotta take care of yourselves! in this world history teaches us nothing!",[chandler and monica look surprised] [she starts to walk out] [exits]
7,10,7,1,"so you like the drums! that's, that's great! y’know, i was worried, that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation. all right, okay, well, apparently not! so, yay!",

7,10,8,9,"yes, thank you. you see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.",
7,10,8,11,maybe on some level.,
7,10,9,2,"hey, joey, i got you another present.",[entering with an aquarium covered by a towel] [she puts it on the counter]
7,10,9,4,"it's a…tarantula! oh! god! rachel, look, i'm sorry. what was i thinking giving joey this big, gross, scary spider in such a poorly constructed cage?",[joey almost falls down from his drum-stool jumping up]
7,10,9,8,"ah, yeah, he's so adorable, god, he's just so much fun, joey is the best, i'm glad you're having so much fun here.","[sarcastic] [she turns around, about to leave]"
7,10,9,10,our apartment is ready.,
7,10,9,12,because you would rather live here with joey.,
7,10,9,14,monica and chandler said that you were having so much fun here. and apparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is gonna change that.,
7,10,9,16,hm?,

7,12,4,2,don’t interrupt me!!,

7,17,5,26,okay! hey! what do i do?!! what are you doing? did you find the dress?,[runs that way and hears another whistle blast.] [heads the other way and hears another blast.] [she runs in the second direction and finds that the whistling is coming from inside a rack. she moves the dresses out of the way to find rachel curled up in a fetal position frantically blowing on the whistle.] [rachel doesn’t stop.] [rachel won’t stop so phoebe pinches her nose shut which causes her to spit the whistle out.]
7,17,5,27,did you find the dress?,
7,17,5,29,i—we gotta get monica.,[she starts to leave.]
7,17,5,31,oh my god!! excuse me! excuse me!,[she grabs rachel’s hand and drags her towards monica.] [she’s knocking women and veils out of the way as she moves.] [she gets to monica who has the dress balled up in one hand and is sitting on megan who is sprawled out on the floor.]
7,17,8,1,i know. hand me a tissue.,"[monica hands her one.] [rachel goes to the fridge, opens it, and blows on the whistle monica gave her at the store, which causes phoebe and monica to turn around and look at her.]"
7,17,8,4,what?!,
7,17,8,6,does that mean carcass is available?,[gasps]
7,17,8,8,well just figure out a way to talk him out of it.,
7,17,10,1,"yeah, swing music is so out.",
7,17,10,7,yeah but the swing kings? y’know they suck so much that people actually die at their concerts—they just stop living.,
7,18,1,1,"oh my god! i’m sorry, too soon. you go.",[joey looks at her.]
7,18,1,4,good for you!,
7,18,3,0,oh my god! that guy at the counter is totally checking you out!,
7,18,3,2,go for it.,
7,18,3,4,"i’m just saying, get his number just in case. but no chandler is in an accident and can’t perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill.",
7,18,3,10,"i did, but that was really fun.",
7,18,5,0,oh hey!,
7,18,5,2,"oh, great! we couldn’t keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while y’know, he’d kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck.",[does that to monica.]
7,18,5,4,"all i could think of was y’know, ""is he gonna kiss me? is he gonna kiss me?""",[laughs]
7,18,5,6,"i’m a lady monica, i don’t kiss and tell. but this hickey speaks for itself.",[she starts to open up her blouse.]
7,18,5,8,i just like him so much that i just feel like i’ve had 10 drinks today and i’ve only had six.,

7,18,12,3,"okay, don’t sweat it. chandler is nowhere around so go ahead get it out of your system. that guy’s cute.",[looking around her.] [points to a guy sitting behind monica.]
7,18,12,5,no that is the last thing you want to do!,
7,18,12,7,because you’re marrying him!,
7,18,12,9,"all right, i’ve never been engaged and i’ve never really been married, but i can only tell you what my mother told me. whenever you have doubts or fears or anxieties about a relationship, do not communicate them to your husband.",
7,18,12,11,"that is correct! yes, you’re supposed to take all of that stuff and put it in a little box in your mind and then lock it up tight.",
7,18,12,13,yes!,
7,18,12,15,oh my god! you’re right! go! go tell chandler! hurry before it’s too late! wait no! does this also mean putting out doesn’t get you love?,[monica starts to leave.] [monica stops.] [monica is shocked.]

7,21,4,60,"okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that rachel knows?",
7,21,4,62,"or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own","[cut to later in that episode. rachel and phoebe are going to a movie from monica and chandler’s, and as phoebe walks by chandler she pinches him on the butt and exits.]"
7,21,4,66,bye chandler! i miss you already.,[she walks up to him.] [quietly.] [she pinches his butt.]

7,21,4,110,here it comes. our first kiss.,[they slowly and hesitantly move their lips together and kiss gently. phoebe has her eyes wide open in shock and chandler is squinting. he finally breaks the kiss after only a short while and pushes phoebe away.]
7,21,4,112,and why not?!,
7,21,4,114,you're-you're what?!,"[monica comes out of the bathroom like a bolt, and rachel and joey both enter.]"

7,21,5,0,"y’know, you’re friend’s getting married, it’s gotta change things.",
7,21,5,2,"how could it not be? i mean pretty soon they’re gonna be having kids, and then they’re just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids. and then maybe they’re gonna have to leave the city to be near a volvo dealership.",

7,22,7,15,there is nothing wrong with jake! okay? he is all man! i’m thinking even more than you.,
7,22,7,17,i’m just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in women’s underwear! i don’t think you could ever do that.,

9,5,12,52,"oh, for gods sake, judy, pick up the sock! pick up the sock! pick up the sock! im sorry, was that rude? di-did my, my li-little outburst blunt the hideousness that is this evening? look, i know, you all have a lot going on, but all i wanted to do was have dinner with my friends on my birthday. and you are all so late and you didnt even have the courtesy to call. well, its too late now.",[getting up] [everybody scared] [?] [?] [her cellular rings]

9,6,2,1,i know!,"[phoebe picks up a little packet of sugar, shakes it, and then realises she can't open it with one hand, but doesn't want to let go of mike's hand. she tries to tear open the packet with one hand.]"
9,6,2,3,"yeah, i kinda do. well, how's this?","[mike lets go of her hand] [she takes mike's hand and puts it on her breast, she tears open the sugar and puts it in her coffee. mike thinks it over and nods appreciative. after that, they hold hands again. joey now enters, and sees the two sitting on the couch, holding hands.]"
9,6,2,5,i'm sorry... i'm sorry. it's obviously way too early for us to be... having that conversation.,
9,6,2,7,"maybe not, is it?",[in a flash she answers]
9,6,2,9,"i know mike, why don't you keep digging?",[impatient]
9,6,2,11,"oh, it's a key. to be honest, i think i'd prefer the five dollars.",

9,6,5,0,i'm... i'm just... i'm the worst person ever. how can i not tell david that i'm seeing mike?,
9,6,5,2,he said are you seeing someone? and i said no ...,
9,6,5,4,"yeah! i mean, i don't know. i was just , i was looking, i was looking in his eyes and i was just thinking oh my god! it's david. david's here. he's just, he's so irresistible.",

9,6,11,2,"no, no. no.",

10,5,5,8,"oh, it’s the worst way to propose!",
10,5,9,0,hi. i just had the worst anniversary ever.,
10,5,9,5,"well, mine was worse than that.",
10,5,9,7,"we were at the game, and this guy proposed to his girlfriend on the big screen thing...",
10,5,9,9,"well, that’s what i said, but it turns out, mike was planning on proposing to me that same way last night!",
10,5,9,13,"yeah, i really do! yes, but, after i dumped on the way he was gonna propose to me, i don’t think he’s ever gonna ask again! i mean, i said no in barbados and now this!",
10,5,9,16,"oh, i don't know, i don't know, isn't that a little desperate?",
10,5,9,20,"well, do you think i should propose?",[to rachel and ross]
10,5,9,23,"ok, ok, so how should i do it?",
10,5,9,27,"yeah, that does make sense. ok, now, would... would you two like that?",[points to ross and chandler]
10,5,9,38,"no, i've got work and then i'm proposing..",

10,5,11,5,"well, i think you should wait.",
10,5,11,7,"well, if you don't... if you don't hold it in, you don't get all the nutrients.",
10,5,11,9,mike hannigan... will you marry me?,[mike looks bewildered]
10,5,11,11,that's not very enlightened!,"[there's booing around them, and mike sinks in his chair, holding his hand in above his eyes, hoping no-one would recognize him]"
10,5,11,12,"hey, hey! boo us? boo you!",[shouting]
10,5,13,0,"that woman at the game didn't know what she was talking about. mike, obviously you have balls.",
10,5,13,2,"i would love it. consider it forgotten... but just so you know... however and whenever you decide to propose, i promise i'll say yes. whether... whether, you know, it is in a basketball game, or in sky writing, or you know, like some lame guy in a cheesy movie who hides it in the cake.","[the waiter puts a piece of cake on the table] [mike's face changes from happy to sad, and he looks at the cake, disappointed.]"
10,5,13,3,"it's in the cake, isn't it?",
10,5,13,5,"what's the matter with me? how do i keep ruining this? i'm sorry, i'm sorry!",
10,5,13,8,oh my god!,[mike starts to kneel in front of phoebe.]
10,5,13,10,wait! oh wait! oh no!,"[she takes off a ring that was already on her left ring finger. after that mike starts to kneel again, but then...] [she was wearing rings on all her fingers and her thumb, and takes all of these off.]"
10,5,13,12,uh-huh!,[and now mike kneels properly]
10,5,13,14,yes!,[mike puts the ring on her finger]
10,5,13,16,i love you more!,
10,6,1,0,hey...,[she enters]
10,6,1,4,"oh, i'm just so exhausted from dragging around this... huge engagement ring!",[she shows her ring]
10,6,1,10,"well, it was really sweet, and like the most romantic thing ever.",
10,6,1,13,"thank you! oh, and i have something for you!",[to rachel]

10,6,1,19,"oh, my first love!",
10,6,1,22,"dead. oh, it's ok, no, he was old , yeah! and he lived a full life, he was in the first wave at omaha beach.",[everyone is a bit upset]
10,6,1,25,"oh yes, they are.",[proud of herself]
10,6,4,0,hey!,[looking at monica entering]
10,6,4,2,"well, i told you i had to spend all the day clearing out stuff, so mike could move in.",
10,6,4,4,yeah.,
10,6,4,6,"oh, it's so hard to get rid of stuff! did you and chandler have to make compromises when you first moved in together?",
10,6,4,8,a bunch of stuff. and the worst one... he wants me to get rid of gladys.,
10,6,4,10,"yeah. i really hate to give her up. oh, i know!! oh, you should take her!",
10,6,4,12,"why, you don't like her?",
10,6,4,14,really? you think?,
10,6,4,16,"ok, i'll fight for her. ok! oh, wait, oh i just realized... if i do that, that means you don't get her.",
10,6,7,0,"hi! sorry, i'm late.",
10,6,7,2,"no, he really hates it. but he's gonna let me keep my box of human hair! so you got to pick your battles. but the good news is, gladys is yours!",
10,6,7,5,"oh, she's that work of art i made, you know, with the woman coming out of the frame.",
10,6,7,7,"oh, i didn't know you wanted her too!",
10,6,7,16,"girls, girls, stop, ok? we'll flip a coin. heads, she's rachel's, tails she's monica's. . tails! monica, she's yours!",[she flips the coin]
10,6,11,0,"well, gladys say hello to your new home!",[smiling from ear to ear] [she holds out the 'painting']
10,6,11,5,"yeah, yeah! and you can get rid of that french poster.",[genuinely excited about it]
10,6,11,7,really? it doesn't have anything coming out of it. or maybe there is some place for her in your bedroom?,
10,6,13,19,hey!,[there's a pause]
10,6,13,24,you guys! you guys! you don't have to fight over her anymore. whoever doesn't get gladys gets glynnis.,[she goes out into the hallway and enters with an even more hideous painting/collage. one of those faceles mannequins heads wearing a blueish dress and orange gloves reaching out into the room. around the head 3 small dolls are hovering.] [rachel and monica are gasping for air at the sight of this monstrous piece of art.]
10,6,15,6,i knew it!,
10,7,1,1,hey!,
10,7,1,6,"it's really crazy! the hall, the dress, the food... i-i had no idea how expensive this stuff was!",
10,7,1,8,so what did you two do about it?,
10,7,1,13,"but really, it does seem like this money could be put to better use?",
10,7,1,15,"yeah! now, how would you feel if we gave all the wedding money to charity and we just got married at city hall?",
10,7,3,1,yes. we're here to make a rather sizeable donation to the children.,
10,7,3,3,"well, i think you're gonna appreciate it the crap out of this one",[she gives him a check]
10,7,3,5,and we don't want any recognition. this is completely anonymous.,
10,7,3,7,mr. x and phoebe buffay.,
10,7,3,10,buffay is spelled b-u-f-f-a-y.,
10,7,3,13,"sure, i so glad we did this. it feels so good!",
10,7,3,15,"oh, look! and we get these free t-shirts!",[she takes a t-shirt which was on the counter]
10,7,3,17,mhm... it's moist.,
10,7,5,4,"hello, is this the creepy residence?",
10,7,5,6,"awe, this is so sweet of you! but you know what? i won’t be needing a veil, i actually won’t be wearing a dress at all!",
10,7,5,8,"no, no, no, we’re not having a big reception, we took the money we were gonna spend on a wedding and we donate them to the children charity.",
10,7,5,10,"we, you know, we’re different! we don’t care about having a huge party. this is really nice for you, but, oh, please, i put this on? and, ow, i look , why, well, radiant. all right, well, who cares, i don’t need a pretty veil and a fancy dress.",[she picks up the veil] [she puts it on] [she looks her reflex image on a toaster] [pause]
10,7,5,12,city hall.,
10,7,5,14,"it’s ok, it’s ok. i made my decision. what i really want is a great big wedding",[she covers her mouth]
10,7,5,17,"well, i’ll just ask for it back!",
10,7,7,1,"it’s for our wedding day! right, now, is this guy gay or straight, because one of us gonna have to start flirting.",
10,7,7,3,"gay, go.",[to mike]
10,7,7,5,"the donation we made earlier, we k…, we w…, we want it back.",
10,7,7,7,"yeah. see, that money was for a big wedding, that we thought we didn’t want, but it turns out we do.",
10,7,7,10,"i am sorry. i am, but this wedding is just really important to me.",
10,7,7,12,"hey, that’s not fair! a person’s wedding is important! and especially to me! ok? i didn’t have a graduation party! and i didn’t go to prom. and i spent my sweet sixteen being chased round a tire yard by an escaped mental patient who is his own words wanted to “kill me” or whatever. so i deserve a real celebration and i am not gonna let some sweaty little man make me feel badly about it.",[ she storms out]
10,7,11,1,oh! it ended okay. one of my friends shot him.,[lightly]
10,7,11,3,"yeah, i really do. you know, i had nothing growing up. just like the kids i took the money from.",[thinks for a few seconds]
10,7,11,5,"look, i can't have a wedding with this money now. it's tainted.",
10,7,11,7,"and if that guy at the charity gives us a hard time, my friend hasn't shot anyone in a really long time.",
10,7,13,0,we're back!,[to the charity guy]
10,7,13,3,"yeah, because you know what, it's... it's all about the children.","[the charity guy smiles wanting to take the check, but phoebe pulls it back again. his smile fades.]"
10,7,13,4,"although... it's also about the wedding... ugh, alright... here. no... oh god... oh!",[she gives the check and pulls it back again]
10,7,13,10,but... but... but we're giving you this!,
10,7,13,12,"well, this is very generous!","[looks at the amount on the check, and gasps]"
10,7,13,16,"oh, is that you?",
10,8,1,2,hey!,
10,8,1,6,hey!,
10,8,1,16,"well, personally i think it's great you're giving yourself a break.",
10,8,1,18,"sure. it's just as well... i mean, last year wasn't very good. i think she's losing her touch.",
10,8,1,20,"am i? really? am i? well, why don't you cook thanksgiving dinner and prove me wrong! well, think about it, think about it, you'll be trying to top than you did last year. you'd be in competition... with yourself.",

10,8,2,14,"well, i wanna enter her in a baby beauty pageant.",
10,8,2,16,"okay, but, well, before you say no, my friend susanne is entering her kid and compared to emma she's a real dog!",
10,8,2,18,oh... okay.,[sarcastic]
10,8,2,22,"okay, oh, and emma needs a cowgirl outfit for the competition.",
10,8,2,24,"well, i was thinking...",
10,8,2,26,yeah!,
10,8,4,1,hey.,
10,8,4,3,"we can't leave now! there was this one baby, haley, who was favourite to win and she got croup, so she had to stay home! this competition just blew wide open, folks!",
10,8,4,5,"oh, i know, we should have been more prepared. it's okay. now, the way i see it, our real competition now is cameron. oh my god, they just took her sweater off. look at those arms! hello michelin man.",[she looks around]
10,8,4,7,"but emma's got what it takes, she could go all the way!",[panicking]

10,15,2,11,"yeah, she was just an agent.",

10,15,4,1,hey. everything ok?,

10,15,4,7,"well, no, no, wait, wait, wait. all right, i gotta go. just listen. promise me, that you will wait a minute before you call her.",

10,15,4,12,"joey, it’s estelle.",[doing estelle]
10,15,4,14,"it’s a little coincidental, but believable. . listen, i’m sure you’re wondering why i didn’t get you an audition for that tv movie.",[doing estelle] [joey nods in agreement]

10,15,7,4,"no, no, no! don't call her! you wait for her to call you",[joey considers it]

10,15,10,2,"joey, it's estelle.","[on the other side of the line, still pretending to be estelle] [joey's eyes bulge up, he looks afraid]"

10,16,10,6,"i don't know. but, god, joey seems to be handling it suprisingly well.","[rachel and joey hug, and rachel turns to enter the apartment through the side window again. at that moment joey tries to climb over the edge of the balcony.]"
10,16,11,5,"you know, maybe she was just really spent from our talk. it was pretty intense.",
10,16,11,9,"ross, if you're this upset, you should go and talk to her.",
10,16,12,2,tell me about it.,
10,16,12,4,"all right, i think i'm gonna head out.",
