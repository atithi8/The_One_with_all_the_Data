4,6,2,8,"okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils.",
4,6,2,10,"oh, it wasn't a big deal. i just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren.",
4,6,2,13,it doesn't say that. does it?,

4,6,5,12,a pen,
4,6,5,14,huh-huh! you can't give her that.,

4,6,5,25,would you like me to write her a little poem as well?,
4,6,8,0,"okay, all right. i just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for kathy that would be better than the rabbit",
4,6,8,2,"oh, yeah. yeah, i found this great place called ""invisible things for kathy."" can you give me a hand with all this stuff?",[motions to an imaginary pile of presents next to him.]
4,6,8,4,"she's really going to love this, you know? the bottom line is i want her to have it, even if i don't get to be the one who gives it to her.",
4,6,8,6,yeah? you don't think it's just pathetic?,
4,6,8,9,where?,
4,6,8,11,i got something for her. it's a book!,"[joey picks up the package, shakes it next to his ear, can't hear anything, switches ears, shakes it again.]"
4,6,8,13,"no, it's a book that's just a book, okay? it's an early edition of the velveteen rabbit . it was her favorite book as a kid. so, uh, just... let me know if she likes it, okay?",
4,6,8,15,"no, it came out to an even twenty.",

4,6,12,33,goodnight.,[goes to his room.]
4,7,1,0,i just walked in the bathroom and saw kathy naked! it was like torture!,[entering in a bathrobe]
4,7,1,2,"it just keeps getting worse and worse! y'know? i mean it’s bad enough that i’m in love with my roommates girlfriend—which by the way, i think she knows. because every time we’re in the room together there’s this weird like energy between us. and call me crazy, but i think she likes me too. and now i have seen her naked. i mean at least when i’ve seen her with clothes on, i could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something. but there are no boles, she’s smooth! smooth!",[leaves] [pause]
4,7,2,3,hey-hey-hey! who was that?,[rushing up]
4,7,2,5,"goin’ out, huh? wow! wow! so things didn’t work out with kathy, huh? bummer.",[does a little celebration dance]

4,7,2,9,wait! you’re going out with kathy!,
4,7,2,11,"well, i’m upset—for you. i mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you.",[he can’t believe he just sad that.]
4,7,2,13,"look, joey, kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. but casey, i mean granted i only saw the back of her head, but i got this sense that she’s-she’s smart, and funny, and gets you.",
4,7,2,15,"all right look, i think it’s time for you to settle down. y'know? make a choice, pick a lane.",
4,7,3,15,"all right! bring it on, you…",
4,7,3,17,oh my god! play!,"[interrupting] [ross starts to play. he plays a key that has a back beat sound attached to it. over the background music he plays the sound of a barking dog, a mooing cow, a laser beam, someone coughing, a jackhammer, a doorbell, a police siren, a ray gun, breaking dishes, and for a closer he plays the sound of a loud crash. basically, the music sucks.]"
4,7,3,19,"really, bitchin’!",
4,7,3,27,"you mean like, music?",
4,7,4,0,"yeah, i know what you’re thinkin’! yes, yes, your breasts are just as firm and juicy.",[there’s a knock on the door.]

5,15,12,15,i'm doing this because i'm sorry?,

6,2,2,4,"no, no, i keep trying, y’know? i can get out, ""joey, i have too…"" but then i lose my nerve and i always finish with, ""…go to the bathroom."" he may think i’m sick.",
6,2,2,6,"oh, so that’s this is gonna work now? you’re just gonna order me around all the time?",
6,2,2,8,all right.,

6,3,1,14,"pheebs, i don’t understand. how can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?",
6,3,1,20,hey-hey! i thought naked thursday’s was just our thing man!,
6,3,3,1,who was it?,
6,3,3,4,sure!,
6,3,3,6,"well, i like that idea. obviously! i was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, y’know? i mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like space invaders and asteroids for $200, the real ones! the big-big ones!",
6,3,3,8,"okay so you mean no as in, ""gee chandler, what an interesting idea. let’s discuss it before we reject it completely.""",
6,3,3,10,"so, that’s it?",
6,3,3,12,which is why asteroids is perfect! it’s the oldest game!,
6,3,3,14,"i don’t have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!",
6,3,3,16,"no, i’m not mocking you, or you beautiful guest room.",[in a mocking voice] [exits.]

6,3,4,3,"""wanted. female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly."" nice!",[reading the ad]
6,3,7,0,hi.,
6,3,7,2,"hi, listen, i’m sorry about before. i don’t need to have a game room. i mean when i was a kid i only played those games because i couldn’t get girls, and now i can ‘em—now, i have you. not-not that i think that i have you or think of you as property in any sort of way, i see women…",[monica glares at him.]
6,3,7,4,really?,
6,3,7,6,ohh.,
6,3,7,8,that’s a great idea! we can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.,
6,3,7,10,we don’t have to come up with this now.,
6,3,7,12,"hey, y’know what? why don’t we think about changes we can make in the living room?",
6,3,7,14,"yeah, i mean we’re gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair.",[kisses her and heads into the living room.]
6,3,7,16,is that a problem?,
6,3,7,18,"oh, that’s cool. then i’ll just bring them both over.",
6,3,7,20,"okay, i get it. so, i get nothing! nothing here is mine! everything here is yours! i’ll get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!",
6,3,7,22,in the game room!,
6,3,7,24,all right! that’s fine! that’s fine! i won’t bring over the chairs! i won’t bring anything over! i wouldn’t want to ruin the ambiance over here at grandma’s place!!,[storms out.]
6,3,8,3,you can call off the roommate search! hi! i’ll be living here.,[entering] [to the potential roommate] [heads for the bathroom.]
6,3,8,5,why did you take the shower curtain down?,
6,3,10,3,"well, why don’t you tell her to stop being silly!",[monica mocks him and he joins in.]
6,3,10,5,"well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.",
6,3,10,7,that’s laughter.,
6,3,10,9,i don’t know.,
6,3,10,11,"yeah, i do.",
6,3,12,2,"he’s being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!",
6,3,12,6,"yeah, i'm not so worried.",
6,3,12,10,of course!,
6,3,12,12,scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.,
6,3,12,14,"okay! , the coffee table forward , and taped a square outline on the floor.]",[they run to the living room where monica has moved the chair back [towards the step] [towards the tv]

6,3,12,17,oh that’s so sweet! i want to show you something too!,
6,3,12,19,"y’know those big-big uh, road signs that say ""merge?""",
6,3,12,21,"y’know? so i was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed. because, that’s you and i together! merge!",

6,4,2,0,hey!,
6,4,2,3,"oh, what’s the matter?",
6,4,2,5,yeah?,
6,4,2,7,what?!,
6,4,2,13,just out of curiosity did she tell you how you’re gonna go?,
6,4,2,16,oh hi!,
6,4,2,26,why don’t you open with a joke?,
6,4,2,28,"wait a minute, hold the phone! you’re not talking about chuckles university?!",
6,4,2,38,that’s the way i did it ‘til i was 19.,
6,4,3,0,hey.,
6,4,3,2,"yes, you got something from the screen actor’s guild.",
6,4,3,4,"""benefits lapsed.""",[opens and reads it]
6,4,3,6,"okay, it’s not a check. they’re saying your health insurance expired because, you didn’t work enough last year.",

6,4,6,2,"that’s great, but shouldn’t you be on the toilet right now?",
6,4,6,4,what’s wrong with you?,
6,4,6,6,this sounds like a hernia. you have to—you-you go to the doctor!,
6,4,6,8,that’s a hernia.,
6,4,9,0,"hey, will you grab me a cruller? sit down! will you go to the hospital?!",[joey starts to groan and get up.]
6,4,9,2,i will loan you the money. just go to the hospital and let’s just get that thing…pushed back in.,
6,4,9,5,hey.,
6,4,9,8,"oh joey’s got a really bad hernia, but that’s nothing a little laser eye surgery won’t fix!",
6,4,15,0,"listen, i’m really glad you got the part.",
6,4,15,2,but are you sure you can do this?,
6,4,15,4,"now, is that never talking about it again?!",
6,4,15,24,"i’m sorry! hey-hey joe, why don’t you uh, lift up your shirt? take a look at this kiddo. we have a crying child ! roll the damn cameras !",[he does.] [alex finally starts crying.]
6,4,18,4,what are you doing?,
6,4,18,6,"oh, all right.","[decided that they are less than human as well, chandler picks up a golf club and monica a frying pan, to join in on the fun of beating their good friend to within an inch of his life!]"
6,5,1,3,what?,
6,5,1,8,"okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage?",
6,5,1,13,"ross, just for my own piece of mind, you’re not married to anymore of us are ya?",
6,5,2,4,you left a shoe here?!,
6,5,2,6,"oh good, when he comes back for his keys, i’ll be sure to give him your shoe.",
6,5,2,10,"yeah, all right.",[not enthused]
6,5,2,12,whoa-whoa-whoa! what?,
6,5,2,15,"yeah, i’m gonna pass. ‘cause i was kinda iffy when it was puppies.",
6,5,5,3,"little baby girl chandler, where i have heard that before? oh right, coach ruben. do you know what pheebs? when you’re done over there, we kinda have a situation over here too.",[tries to get her to drink a little more from the bottle when he suddenly smells something. it’s times like these i’m glad smell-o-vision hasn’t been invented.] [phoebe is changing hers.]
6,5,5,5,see that’s where i think that you’re wrong. we’ve been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.,
6,5,5,7,"i just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone. phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. and y’know mon, you can be in charge of diapering and i can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around…","[he degrades into baby talk, but he means when they grab his finger.]"
6,5,5,9,"okay, i’m a rookie. i should not be in the end zone.","[time lapse, they have set up a little assembly line for diaper changes. phoebe wipes, chandler adds the powder, begrudgingly, and monica puts the diaper on.]"
6,5,5,13,hey!,
6,5,5,16,shocking! since you still have the keys.,
6,5,5,18,what equity investments?,
6,5,5,21,you don’t even have a car!,
6,5,5,23,and?,
6,5,5,25,there you are.,
6,5,7,2,"check it out! check it out! when the babies wake up, they can meet krog!",[entering] [he holds up this xena-like warrior action figure.]
6,5,7,4,he can do more than that! he can destroy the universe!,
6,5,7,6,"they’re not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way over protective. when i was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!",
6,5,7,8,"glass, sand, whatever.",[walks out as monica and phoebe turn to check on the babies again.]
6,5,7,13,all right. i thought about it and maybe you’re right. maybe krog is not a safe toy.,[entering] [clears throat]
6,5,7,15,i swallowed the sonic blaster gun.,
6,5,7,17,"well, i was trying to prove that i was right. y’know? and it turns out i was wrong. and now it’s lodged in my throat.",[mimics a cat trying to cough up a hairball.] [he does it again.]
6,5,9,1,but you found the keys to his clothes?,
6,5,9,5,that is true.,
6,5,9,10,"ahh, i think it just moved. it’s really poking me.",
6,5,9,17,i think that’s gum.,
6,5,9,19,"okay, listen this really hurts. let’s go.",
6,5,11,1,hey!,[entering]
6,5,11,3,"well, let’s just say that krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours.",
6,5,11,5,and protected them from a tornado?,[monica enters and her jaw drops in horror.]
6,5,11,11,was the setting of phoebe’s triumph.,
6,5,11,13,is not as important as the fact that phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.,
6,5,11,15,"phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!",[pause]
6,6,1,0,"okay! listen, i’m gonna be moving out so you will be in charge of paying the rent.",[watches joey for a moment] [joey quickly moves the hockey stick so that he’s scratching his back with it.]
6,6,1,2,first of the month.,
6,6,1,4,"no, just the months you actually want to live here.",
6,6,1,6,"okay, here is the phone bill.",[hands it to joey.]
6,6,1,8,"that’s our phone number. now look, i know i kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing, so why don’t i just—why don’t i just cover you for a while?",
6,6,1,10,"it’s not charity, joe…",
6,6,1,12,"okay uh, here’s the electric bill.",[hands it to him.]
6,6,1,14,"uh, yeah.",[joey runs over and shuts off the lights.]
6,6,1,15,"so, we’ll do the rest of the bills later then?",
6,6,2,1,"no, i hope not! i tried to offer him some money, but he wouldn’t take it.",

6,12,5,7,picking rachel.,
6,12,5,9,maybe it’s the sound of ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts.,
6,12,8,2,so is your apron. you’re wearing it like a cape.,
6,12,8,9,"i think it’s great that you work here. you’re going to make a lot of money, and here’s your first tip don’t eat yellow snow. . ah ha ha, 2 15, coffeehouse.","[he laughs, then picks up a pen, glares at ross, and writes in his journal]"

6,12,11,27,i’m not arguing with that.,
6,12,11,31,is not.,
6,12,12,1,"hi, oh hi.",
6,12,12,3,"monica is a self-sufficient, together lady. being with her has been like being on a vacation. and what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and— —generosity of spirit.",[starts to recite a rehearsed speech] [pause.] [he falters and monica prompts him.]
6,12,12,7,i’m out of words. should i just say the whole thing again?,[to chandler]
6,12,12,9,you’re a little high maintenance.,[pauses as he struggles with what he has to say]
6,12,12,11,"i’m sorry. you’re not easy-going, but you’re passionate, and that’s good. and when you get upset about the little things, i think that i’m pretty good about making you feel better about that. and that’s good too. so, they can say that you’re high maintenance, but it’s okay, because i like … maintaining you.",
6,12,12,13,i’m off the list.,[happily] [sits on the couch.]

6,14,7,3,there’s no back to this couch!,
6,14,7,5,"yeah i know, but i figured a shot y’know? maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldn’t think i was y’know, all dead inside.",

6,15,9,14,"oh you wouldn’t uh, care. it’s just a stupid comic book story.",
6,15,9,16,"well uh, archie needs money to fix his jalopy , uh but he doesn’t want reggie to just give him the money. so reggie hires him as his assist—as his butler. and then makes him do all these crazy things like bring him milkshakes that can’t have lumps in them.",[joey laughs]
6,15,14,8,"no, the doctors say it may kill her.",

6,15,28,8,"yeah! when you were talking about roger, that was killing me! look, things like last night they don’t just happen. y’know? or at least not to me. or with the other two women, in the morning y’know i was just lying there and i couldn’t wait to just go hang out with my friends, but with you i always y’know with a friend.",
6,15,28,10,"i know you probably don’t want to go out with me, y’know because i make too many jokes and i’ve never been in a serious relationship and i guess i’m not technically a ""doctor…""",[monica runs over and kisses him.]

6,24,2,1,hey!,
6,24,2,4,"well, monica and chandler can’t go. we’re going to dinner remember?!",[glaring at her]
6,24,2,7,i just get mad when rachel doesn’t remember where we’re going.,

6,24,7,1,"one nation, under god. indivisible with liberty and justice for all. i remembered it. the champagne is here.",[trying to cover up why his hand is over his heart] [laughs.] [it’s a butchered version of the pledge of allegiance of the united states for our foreign friends.] [the waiter is delivering it and pouring two glasses.]
6,24,7,3,yes! yes! i’m good! are you good? are you good? is everything—are you—are you perrr-perfect?!,
6,24,7,5,"oh, yeah. uh, no you can’t have my jacket! because then i would be cold! if you thought that you were going to be cold, you should’ve brought your own jacket. but uh, other than that, are you okay? are you okay?",[starts to take it off and then realizes]
6,24,7,7,"yes! i’m fine. in fact i’ve been fine for a long time now and i think, the reason is you.",
6,24,7,9,"okay umm, before i meant you i had really little life and i couldn’t imagine growing old with…",[as he’s talking monica notices someone familiar has just entered the restaurant. let’s see; i seem to remember him driving a ferrari in hawaii solving crimes as a private investigator and as a certain eye doctor in more recent times.]

7,6,5,21,"well, you know what they say, elephants never forget. seriously, good luck marrying me.",[monica is not amused by that statement.]
7,6,7,1,can you figure out what i’m doing?,
7,6,7,3,who?,
7,6,7,5,because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?!,
7,6,7,7,what? are you kidding? that was like 16 years ago.,
7,6,7,9,"okay, i will do it. but i have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you feel in love with!",
7,6,9,0,"julie hi! chandler bing, i, i guess you remember me.",[she opens the door]
7,6,9,2,"it’s a nickname, i’ll explain later.",[to monica]
7,6,9,4,"ah, uh, i owe you a long overdue apology. i never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.",
7,6,9,6,"you-you-you didn’t know that. well, i guess my work here is done!",[pause as she nods no.]
7,6,11,0,as bad as that went i actually enjoyed myself. i think that i’m going to apologize for all of the stupid things i do.,
7,6,11,2,i would really love it if could do both.,
7,6,11,4,what?,
7,6,11,6,what?!,
7,6,11,8,a hundred and forty-five pounds.,
7,6,11,10,"look i know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but i was 15!",
7,6,11,12,"okay. okay, now wait a minute that was totally different.",
7,6,11,14,you were not supposed to hear that! i said that behind you back!,
7,6,11,16,"look you have to realize i don’t think of you as a thin, beautiful woman. see this is one of things that i can apologize for later! look, what i mean is you’re monica! okay? and i am in love with monica.",[monica glares at him.]
7,6,11,18,so you can balloon up or you can shrink down and i will still love you.,
7,6,11,20,i’d carry you around in my pocket.,
7,6,11,22,skidmark’s still got a way with the ladies.,
7,7,2,0,…come on! why are we here?!,
7,7,2,2,the hot chicks?,
7,7,2,4,wow that’s actually pretty cool.,
7,7,2,6,sounds like two people are really enjoying the dewey decimal system.,"[they go around the last row of bookshelves and find a couple doing what college coeds do in secluded corners of university libraries. for those of you who don’t know what i’m talking about, let’s just say that clothing is undone. ross gasps and the couple gets up and runs away.]"
7,7,2,9,"you didn’t bring me here to do that, did you?",
7,7,3,10,"oh…my…gawd! i am so sorry sweetie, are you okay? you didn’t tell her we were getting married, did you?",
7,7,3,12,did she freak out?,

7,7,3,22,what do you think she’s just gonna sit there quietly? you don’t think she’s gonna want to make a toast? you don’t think she’s gonna want to grab the microphone and sing part-time lover ?!,
7,7,3,24,y’know what? it’s gonna be okay. y’know what? she’s probably not gonna even want to come.,
7,7,3,26,no! that was a lie ! see how easy that was?,
7,7,3,28,yes!!,
7,7,3,30,yes!!!,
7,7,8,5,"well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding. um, it’s going to be a small ceremony. uh, tiny! we’re not even sure why we’re having it.",
7,7,12,1,i say we go with careless whisper,[there’s a knock on the door and janice enters.]
7,7,12,3,did she see us yet? did she see us?,[to monica]
7,7,12,8,aren’t you just a tinsy bit curious?,
7,7,12,13,"no-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever !",
7,7,12,15,is that what you’re thinking about right now?,
7,7,12,18,"janice, i’m sorry but umm, you can’t stay here tonight.",
7,7,12,20,"honestly? our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. now monica and i have been immunized, but sadly you have not.",[and she does the laugh.]

7,7,12,28,"feelings, such strong feelings.",

7,8,1,4,"no, we're playing this game i learned at work. you have to name all the states in six minutes.",
7,8,1,6,"now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. you always forget at least one, or in some cases... fourteen .",[looks over to monica]
7,8,1,10,"oh, okay, time's up!",
7,8,1,12,"oh that's not bad, pheebs?",
7,8,1,14,"okay, so rachel's got 48 and phoebe has the lead in…vegetables, joey?",
7,8,2,1,does south oregon have a sports-team? there you go.,[joey strikes one from his list] [cut to the girls in the kitchen.]
7,8,2,10,oooh that may be a new world's record,[looks at his watch and picks up ross' pad]
7,8,2,12,"uh, magellan? you got 46 states.",[smiles and hands ross back his pad]
7,8,2,16,"i am only one man! okay ross, time is up!",[monica heads out]
7,8,2,18,"look ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay? that is the beauty of this game. it makes you want to kill yourself.",
7,8,2,20,"okay, but if you can't…no dinner!",
7,8,2,28,"sure, and joey; do not let ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment.",
7,8,3,1,i don't know. maybe it's because it smells a little weird. it's like old pumpkins or something.,
7,8,3,3,which smells delicious!,
7,8,3,5,what?,
7,8,4,4,"tell her, i'm allergic, and i will sue!",
7,8,4,17,huh! where is the dog?!,
7,8,4,22,"phoebe, we can hear the dog barking!",
7,8,4,24,what is it doing here?,
7,8,4,27,"extremely allergic, okay? if i'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up!",
7,8,4,29,really?,[gasping]
7,8,4,31,"well, it still has to go, right? monica and",
7,8,4,33,"okay, it's um…",
7,8,4,36,"i have to! okay? it's time! okay, i hate dogs.","[to joey] [joey shrugs as if to say, ""do what you have to do""]"
7,8,4,42,"they are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit.",
7,8,4,45,is there a puppy here?,[scared]
7,8,4,47,"okay, you are new!",[to tag]
7,8,4,51,"okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable.",
7,8,4,53,"and i don't wanna say this, i don't you guys to hate me, but uh, i don't think, i can be around that dog anymore. okay, so either the dog goes, or i go. oh my god!!","[an awkward silence ensues.] [time lapse, ross is still doing chandler's game. tag is heading for the balcony.]"
7,8,7,1,here i am.,[comes out of the bathroom]
7,8,7,3,how did you…know?,[heads back into the bathroom] [phoebe waves monica in. monica sneaks in with the bag with clunkers in it and heads for phoebe's room.]
7,8,7,10,where's monica?,[comes out of the bathroom]
7,8,7,12,why not?,[we can hear the dog whining at a high pitch.]
7,8,7,14,"well, i, i should go in there.",
7,8,7,16,why not?,
7,8,7,18,this is ridiculous.,[he heads for phoebe's bedroom]
7,8,7,21,"monica's all upset, because i sent clunkers away.",
7,8,7,23,"yeah, i can be a hero, i could do that. i could, i could do... i, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me?",
7,8,7,25,and that doesn't scare you?,[he walks out]
7,8,7,34,"no, no he went for a walk.",
7,8,7,41,"please, please, please, don't be mad at me.",
7,8,7,44,"okay, i went over to ross' apartment to bring back clunkers. y’know, for you, and… i left the door open and she must have gotten out and i looked everywhere , all over the apartment, including the roof, which fyi ross, one of your neighbors, growing weed. i couldn't find him, and i am so, so, so, sorry. but i do know where we could all go ease the pain.",[clears his throat] [points up and then over to the street]
7,8,7,47,clunkers?! oh my god!,
7,8,7,50,it is so good to see you!,[to clunkers]
7,8,7,53,it's up to you.,[ross whines and starts working again. the door opens and tag enters.]

7,9,2,0,hey! what are you guys doing?,
7,9,2,3,"i’m sorry, who?",
7,9,2,5,but we don’t know the neighbors.,
7,9,2,8,wouldn’t it be easier if we just moved?,
7,9,2,10,"eh, somebody’s in a good mood!",
7,9,4,1,"well, either that or uh…",[motions towards joey’s door.]

7,9,8,23,"yeah, that’s her.",

7,9,8,28,stop making candy!,
7,9,8,30,you mean they like you.,
7,9,8,32,is that why you became a chef? so that people would like you?,
7,9,12,0,what is going on?,[asking a man leaning against the wall]
7,9,12,3,joey!,
7,9,12,5,what are you doing?,
7,9,12,7,"get in here! hey, and you can not smoke in here! merry christmas.","[they head for the door and chandler sees smokes-a-lot lady standing next to the door and smoking, to her] [takes the cigarette and takes a drag for himself.] [exhaling in ecstasy]"
7,9,12,10,"all right everybody! just be quiet! be quiet! be quiet!! pipe-pipe-pipe down! what is the matter with you people?! this woman was trying to do a nice thing for you. she was making candy so she could try to get to know all of you, and i’ll bet that not one of you can tell me her name! am i right?",[they settle down]

7,10,2,12,"well, she's just so much fun with joey, i just assumed, she'd still be living with him.",
7,10,2,14,"no reason, except…she…told…me.",
7,10,2,16,"no! no, she didn't say that. i-i-i think you should talk to monica now.",
7,10,2,21,"bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?",
7,10,4,0,"hi, could we get two burritos to go, please?",[to the maitre d'] [laughs.]
7,10,4,3,forty-five minutes? we have tickets to the musicman at 8 pm.,

7,10,6,7,excuse me...,"[walks up to the maitre d'] [chandler can't find his money in the pocket. in the meantime, another couple shows up, and chandler turns away to look for his money]"
7,10,6,9,ahh-hahaha!,"[finds his money] [turns around to give the maitre d' his money, but he isn't there anymore]"
7,10,8,1,"thank you gunther, put it there. definitely not easier with coins. thank you.","[he gets up, and shakes gunther's hand. a bunch of coins fall out his hand. he sits down next to monica.] [joey gets up and picks up the coins. chandler thinks, joey is just helping him to pick them up.]"
7,10,8,5,hey pheebs!,
7,10,8,7,"if you wanna give joey a christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a vile of small pox to release in the hallway?",
7,10,11,16,"ho, ho, ho! merry christmas!",[entering in a santa costume]
7,10,11,18,hey!,[grunts as ben hits him at full speed.]

7,10,11,29,why?,
7,10,11,31,but i didn't get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly.,
7,10,11,33,"fine, i'll give the suit back.",[ross turns around and walks back to ben.]
7,10,11,35,santa? really?,
7,10,11,37,did your dad ever dress up like santa?,
7,10,11,39,then it's okay!,[they kiss.]
7,10,11,42,"because, if santa and the holiday…armadillo? ...are ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode. merry christmas!",[ross nods]
7,10,11,45,"well, i'll stay, but only because i wanna hear about hanukkah. ben, will you sit here with santa and learn about hanukkah?",
7,10,13,5,my favorite part was when superman flew all the jews out of egypt.,[glaring at joey who’s nodding.]

7,11,1,6,i—no! i didn't read the box before i opened it. and you can't return a box after you've opened the box.,
7,11,1,8,because it's too delicious.,
7,11,1,10,"no-no-no! it is going to be okay, because mrs. braverman is gonna send away for a free one and that way we all win! the only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate, momma’s little bakery. i feel terrible, i’m a horrible, horrible, horrible person.",[reading the label] [pause]
7,11,2,1,so…,

7,11,2,20,i used to undress my cousin glenn.,[monica looks at him then sushes him.]
7,11,4,1,another cheesecake came! they delivered it to the wrong address again!,
7,11,4,3,i can’t seem to say goodbye.,
7,11,4,5,well i’ve forgotten what it tastes like okay?!,
7,11,4,7,y’know what? forget it! we are just hungry! we have not had lunch! we are just light-headed! so let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake.,[closing the box]
7,11,4,9,good idea. where do you want to go to lunch?,
7,11,6,0,"well, thank you for lunch.",
7,11,6,2,so apparently we just don’t pay for food anymore. do you see what i see?,[rachel laughs then chandler notices something.]
7,11,6,4,mrs. braverman must be out.,[they move closer to it.]
7,11,6,6,"by then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. we don’t want her to come back to bad cheesecake.",
7,11,6,8,"well, we don’t want that.",
7,11,6,10,but we should take it.,

7,11,12,0,are you eating the cheesecake without me?!,
7,11,12,2,i will give you a hundred dollars to whistle right now. how can you eat the cheesecake without me?!,[she tries to whistle and blows little chunks of cheesecake out of her mouth.]
7,11,12,4,"y’know what? i don’t trust you with this cake anymore! and i got it first, and i’m takin’ it back!",[grabs the cheesecake and heads for his apartment.]

7,11,12,16,"okay well, this side looks bigger. uh… there’s more crust on this side. y’know? so, maybe if i measured…",[examining the cake]
7,11,12,18,"all right, i’ll pick that one.",[points.]
7,11,12,20,ohhh!,[gloatingly and holding his piece]

7,13,10,0,"my chair. now, if anybody asks, your name is rosita!","[he runs out the door, grabs the back of rosita, and we can hear joey and rachel talking as they are coming up the stairs. neither of them have reached the landing yet.]"

9,7,5,10,"we're not gonna have this conversation again... look at this place. why am i so intimidated by this guy? pretentious art, this huge macho couch. when we know all he does is sit around all day crying about losing monica to a real man! you don't think he's here, do you?",[laughs] [joey looks around]
9,7,5,12,"look at these videos. you know, i mean, who does he think he is? magnum force, dirty harry, cool hand luke... oh my god!",[chandler looks around the place and his eye gets caught by richard's video collection]

9,7,5,16,get there faster!,[joey gasps and finally understands...]
9,7,8,0,"i'm not gonna watch it... i don't need to watch it... i mean, what good could possibly come from watching? well, we know i'm gonna watch it.",[sighs] [chandler moves to put the tape in the vcr and joey enters the apartment]
9,7,8,2,"don't judge me, i'm only human!",
9,7,8,4,"i had to! okay, imagine you were married... and you found a tape of your wife in another guys' apartment... wouldn't you need to know what was on it?",
9,7,8,6,some girl...!?,
9,7,8,8,yeah...!?,
9,7,8,10,"allright, i'm gonna watch it... i mean look, it's probably not even what i think it is... and even if it is... it can't possibly be as bad as what i'm picturing in my head... can it?",[laughs nervously]
9,7,8,12,then you're gonna have to watch it for me.,
9,7,8,14,"just for a few seconds, so i can know what it is... please?",
9,7,8,16,why am i hearing cheering?,
9,7,8,18,football? just football?,

9,7,11,1,whoho ho... listen to the judgement from the porn star!,
9,7,11,5,"because that's who i am, okay? i'm sure a mature man like richard could see a tape like that and it wouldn't bother him. just'd be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men's club over brandy and moustaches.",
9,7,11,7,this is about you and richard. he's clearly not over you. he keeps a tape so he can... look at it whenever he wants.,
9,7,11,9,"oh, yeah, well, poor richard. y'... i can grow a moustache!",
9,7,11,11,"yeah, oh, but i just keep picturing you rolling around with him with your cowboy boots in the air...",

9,8,1,3,"honey, she keeps canceling on us, take the hint.",
9,8,1,5,what is the point of having them if we never use them?,
9,8,1,7,i will explain it to her.,

9,8,3,3,why?,
9,8,3,5,"oh suddenly, flowers are feminine?",[ phoebe comes in]
9,8,5,33,i can't believe you'd want us to raise emma.,
9,8,5,38,"you know, guys i got to say. this means so much to me. that you would trust me with your child. i mean, we all know that monica and i have been trying to have a baby of our own. you know i've had my doubts about my skills as a father, but that you two.. that you two....",[starts to cry]
9,8,5,55,"no, if crazy plate lad.. if monica dies then i would get emma, right?",[sees monica frustrated at this comment] [ross and rachel pause and ponder this]
9,8,5,57,actually what?,
9,8,5,59,what?,
9,8,5,62,"so if monica's not around, then i'm not good enough to raise emma?",
9,8,5,65,well what is wrong with me? am i .. am i incomptent? because i managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you!,
9,8,5,70,"look, i may not know a lot about babies, but do you really think i'm not capable?",
9,8,5,72,ok. so if we both had emma and i die she'd have to give her up.,[knocks on table]
9,8,5,75,"so.. let me get this straight. so my two friends die, i get emma. then my wife dies, then emma the one tiny ray of hope left in my life gets taken away from me?",
9,8,5,78,oh? did somebody miss me? is there a child to raise poorly?,
9,8,5,80,"yeah but they're right. i mean, i'm not a strong father figure and i never will be.",
9,8,5,82,"yeah, but its not who i am. everything they said was exaclty why i was worried about having a kid. and its true. and look everybody knows it.",
9,8,5,84,"oh yeah, well can you picture me saying ""go to your room! you're grounded""?",
9,8,5,86,you said that to me last week.,
9,8,6,12,"oh no thats okay, you're totally right. i don't know anything about disciplining a child. but it did hurt my feelings and i want you to know that when i die, you don't get joey.",[ross walks away with a face of yeah ok.]
9,8,6,59,"alright! that is it. this is our apartment and you can not behave this way. now if you can't act your age then you shouldn't be here at all. now those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones i picked out, but they're very important to monica. i want you to apologize to her right now.",
9,8,6,62,okay. thats better. now i want you to both apologize to each other and mean it.,
9,8,6,64,"by the way, that fight was totally arousing.",
9,8,6,66,oh yeah? well thanks.,
9,8,6,68,"okay, but you should know he eats five times a day and shoves pennies up his nose.",[ross ponders that and walks away]
9,8,6,80,"oh no no no.. i'll get her. i'm super-compentent and totally responsibile and fourth in line to raise emma. i'll be right there emma. just let me get my trusty diaper bag here. well.. what do you know? i guess, i'll be the one who dies first. commercial break",[knocks over the box of china]
9,8,7,1,nope...,
9,8,7,3,yep...,
9,8,7,5,"nope... hey... so i'm gonna... put the plates back. you know, i think you were right, i don't think we should use these plates again for a looong time.",[monica walks in]

9,9,3,10,"no, no, no, no, no.â joey can't know that i'm here.",[hushed]
9,9,3,12,"because i didn't know how to tell him that i couldn't go to the knicks game.â so, i just told him that i had to stay in tulsa.",

9,21,10,4,i haven't... i haven't even thought about the results yet... i just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.,
9,21,10,6,"yeah, but what if it's not? what if there is a reason why we can't have a baby?",[slightly panicky]
9,21,10,8,"oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks. i can't believe i didn't even think of that. i guess i was just so worried about having to... come here and do... 'that'...",[smiling again]
9,21,10,10,"it was a ""wendy's!! ""","[stares at her intently, then yells]"
9,21,13,0,it is not okay that i'm aroused by this now.,[picking up a plastic cup similar to the one he deposited his specimen in] [phone rings]
9,21,13,1,"hello? oh hi, doctor connelly. no, she's not here but, you know, i can tell her. should i be sitting down for this? oh. well, so what does that mean? ok. ok, thank you. thanks.",[pause] [his smile fades as he hears the answer] [pause] [pause] [hangs up] [monica walks in]
9,21,13,3,doctor connelly just called.,
9,21,13,5,actually it's both of us.,
9,21,13,7,apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable environment.,
9,21,13,9,it means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do. it means...,[pause]
9,21,13,11,"it means that we can keep trying, but there's a good chance this may never happen for us.",[seriously]
9,21,13,13,i'm sorry.,
9,21,13,15,"well, we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out.",
9,22,2,0,wow! fortunately she has a very pretty face!,[looking at the picture of the female reproductive system]
9,22,2,2,"oh, i can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when i was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!!",
9,22,2,4,hi.,
9,22,2,9,"oh, damn it!",[dr. connelly glares at chandler]
9,22,2,14,"is that a hint? because we love you doctor connelly but we don't think we'd want you to be our child! wow, talking about an inhospitable environment!",[dr. connelly glares at him]
9,22,3,16,hey guys!,[entering]
9,22,3,18,"i think i can safely say that we all have family issues, work stuff and/or are sick.",
9,22,3,20,but you come first!,
9,22,3,25,ok.,[sitting down on the couch]
9,22,3,27,not as much fun as last time. apparently you only get porn if you're giving a sperm sample.,
9,22,3,29,"well... there's surrogacy, but monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her.",
9,22,3,31,yeah.,
9,22,3,33,"aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... we're talking about sperm donors.",
9,22,3,35,ah-ha!,[stopping joey]
9,22,3,37,i wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but i don't think there is one.,
9,22,6,1,"hey! look i brought a friend for dinner, this is zack, from work!",
9,22,6,4,"you guys haven't actually met before, but, boy! you're both polite! go to have a seat zack, and i'll get you a beer.",[pause]
9,22,6,7,"so, zack's pretty nice, uh?",[to mon]
9,22,6,9,"so, how would you like to have a baby that's half yours and half his!",
9,22,6,11,"well, we're talking about sperm donors and zack may be the guy! i mean, look, he's intelligent, he's healthy, he's athletic, i mean, he is ""spermtastic""!",
9,22,6,13,"no, i invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him! i mean, if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy, get to check him out.",
9,22,6,15,"i'm telling you, he's great! i mean, even if my sperm worked fine, i'd think he'd be the way to go!",
9,22,6,17,ok!,
9,22,6,19,zack!,[bringing the beer to zack]
9,22,9,2,"so what do you think? i want that guys genes for my kid! those eyes, those cheeckbones!",
9,22,9,4,you don't like him.,
9,22,9,6,alright! just follow my lead!,[zack comes out of the bathroom. they all sit down at the table.]
9,22,9,8,"oh! thanks, i'm crazy about our place. hey! speaking of crazy... do you have a history of mental illness in the family?",
9,22,9,10,that's really not the kind of thing we are looking for zack.,[very seriously]
9,22,9,18,you know what's not funny? male pattern baldness,"[monica stretches her neck to look behind zack's head and then gives chandler an ""ok"" sign]"
9,22,9,20,chandler sure! alright...,
9,22,9,22,i noticed you were enjoying that ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth. did you have braces as a child?,
9,22,9,25,we're teeth people zack!,[proceeding with his dinner]
9,22,13,34,you sure you don't wanna stick around a little longer?,
9,22,13,36,"are you just tired now or are you always tired, 'cause that could be a sign of clinical depression.",
9,22,13,38,ok.,[zack leaves]
9,22,13,39,i think we've found our sperm!,
9,22,13,41,"yeah, you think so, well? should i ask him?",
9,22,13,43,"why not, just because his great-grandmother was obese, our kids are gonna get that from you anyway!",
9,22,13,45,"yeah, he's better!",
9,22,13,47,really? are you sure?,
9,22,13,49,"thank god, because i don't wanna do this either. you know, i was just doing because i thought that was what you wanted to do. you know, i'm the husband, i'm supposed to... bring the sperm.",[sighs with relief]
9,22,13,51,so you know this leaves us with...,
9,22,13,53,how do you feel about that?,
9,22,13,55,me too. i wanna find a baby that needs a home and i wanna raise it with you. and i wanna mess it up in our own specific way.,
9,22,13,57,yeah.,[smiling]
9,22,13,59,we are gonna be great parents.,
9,22,13,61,"wait, if we're lucky, and we're really really really quiet, we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking!",[they hug]
9,22,14,0,"hey, zack!",
9,22,14,2,"look, i just wanted to apologize for last night. i got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable.",
9,22,14,4,really?,
9,22,14,6,"my wife and i have some boundary issues, you know, sometimes we ask inappropriate questions. we're working on it.","[zack's pregnant secretary, jeanette, walks in]"
9,22,14,9,"you wouldn't know if jeanette's planning on keeping her baby, would ya?",
9,23,1,7,"yeah ross, i mean... we're excited to hear the speech but the rest of the time we're gonna wanna do, you know, ""island's stuff"".",
9,23,3,3,"yeah, that's the same as ""it has something to do with wind"".",
9,23,3,11,she does?,[upset]
9,23,4,1,i wouldn't read too much into it.,
9,23,4,3,"david, let me stop you there 'cause i think i see where this is going. i'm not very good at giving advice. so if you want advice, go to ross, monica, or... joey, if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee.",
9,23,4,5,"seriously, we're gonna do this?",
9,23,4,7,"oh, because his penis was too big. oh, i'm sorry, that's the kind of thing i do. they broke up because mike didn't want to get married. hey, what if you just let phoebe know you'd be open to marriage?",[he notices that david is not amused] [pause]
9,23,4,9,what?,
9,23,4,11,i didn't mean now ...,
9,23,4,13,"well, you're welcome! glad i could help.",
9,23,4,15,"david, i'm pretending to read here!!",
9,23,6,1,"i do! want a hint? huh? ""i do"" ""i do"".","[smiling cheekily] [monica looks confused, so chandler repeats]"
9,23,6,3,david is going to propose to phoebe.,
9,23,6,5,"be-cause, we were talking about ways that he could beat mike and i told him that phoebe wanted to get married.",
9,23,6,7,"i did ! a penis one! look, just so i know, what was so wrong about what i said?",
9,23,6,9,"man, that's some bad advice!",
9,23,7,5,that's why our honeymoon photos look like me and diana ross!,
9,23,7,15,"tonight?! isn't an engagement ring supposed to have a diamond? oh, there it is!",[looks at the ring] [squints at the ring to emphasize how tiny the diamond is]
9,23,7,17,nice!,[slaps him on the shoulder] [goes to monica]
9,23,7,18,"monica, can i talk to you for a sec?",[pulls her away from phoebe and rachel]
9,23,7,20,david is going to propose to phoebe tonight !,
9,23,7,22,that would be advice!!,
9,23,8,7,"oh, is it on the computer, cuz i'd love to give it a read...?",
9,23,8,9,what? may i?,[offended] [pause]
9,23,8,13,"oh, no, no, no dear god, no!",[at the laptop]
9,23,8,15,"your computer, i don't know wha... everything's gone!",
9,23,8,17,it must be a virus. i think it erased your hard drive.,
9,23,8,19,someone i don't know sent me an e-mail and i opened it.,
9,23,8,21,"well, it didn't say ""this is a virus""!!",
9,23,8,23,nude... ... pictures of anna kournikova. i'm so sorry.,[ross looks at him]
9,23,8,25,"it's not gone ! i mean, i'm sure you printed out a copy. you have a hard copy, right?",
9,23,8,27,"well, you must be pretty mad at yourself right now...!",
9,23,9,2,i just feel awful.,
9,23,9,4,"well, i tried billy jean king, but... you know, you and monica have the same ""i'm gonna kill you"" look...? i can usually make it go away by kissing her...",[ross glares at him] [ross continues to glare at him and chandler leans in as if he's going to kiss ross]
9,23,10,9,"oooh! i hope you're happy too, honey!",[pretending not to sense the tone]
9,23,10,11,"phoebe is going to say ""yes""? that's, that's great!",
9,23,10,13,and there's not chance that will work?,
9,23,10,15,oooooooh! meddler! meddler!,[pointing at her]
9,23,10,17,this vacation sucks!!,
9,23,14,1,"you know, it's very hard to take you seriously when you look like that.",[david and phoebe sit down at a table close to chandler and monica's]
9,23,14,4,"i think we have some time. have you ever heard him talk? ""uh, phoebe, uh, i would be honoured, uh..."" spit it out, david!",[doing david]
9,23,14,28,"i wouldn't brag too much about that thing, big guy.",
9,23,15,0,"oh, ain't this nice? it's so quiet, i could just lie here all day.",
9,23,15,3,i'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms!,[rachel opens the drapes]
9,23,15,5,hey! remember when i had corneas?,
9,23,15,7,ladies? ross's speech is in 45 minutes.,
9,23,16,3,not to mention the cold sores.,[to a paleontologist sitting next to him] [the paleontologist glares at chandler]
9,23,16,5,really?,[to the one sitting next to him]
9,23,18,5,i don't think so!,
9,23,18,7,"because you know how competitive you get and well, i say it's cute, others disagree, and i'm lying!",
9,23,18,9,"oh, yeah ? what happened when we played last time?",
9,23,18,11,and...?,
9,23,20,5,i'm not playing with you.,
9,23,20,10,she gets crazy! this scar is from pictionary !,[points to his forehead] [monica rolls her eyes]

9,23,20,26,ok!,[interrupting her]
9,23,20,29,"honey, try to focus the trash talk on him!",
9,23,23,7,do you really find this attractive on him?,[to phoebe]
9,23,23,9,i think this is the first time in our marriage that i've felt like the more attractive one.,
9,23,23,18,"okay-dokay, you've each won a game and i've lost what's felt like a year of my life. so everybody goes home a winner.",
9,23,23,21,should i use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil?,
9,23,25,1,"ok, look! enough is enough!",[exhausted]
9,23,25,3,"monica, that was also true an hour ago! i mean, please, look at you! your hand is blistered, you can barely stand, your hair is inexplicable ! ok, you've already proven you are just as good as he is, now we've missed our dinner reservations, so now let's just go upstairs, order room service, take a shower and shave your head!",

10,1,1,11,"he could be alone. this morning i heard him do push-ups, and then talk to his triceps.",
10,1,1,16,she's cheating on joey with ross!,

10,1,1,66,you got it!,
10,1,1,108,"okay, well we'll go back in there, but will you do one thing for us? the people that care about you?",

10,1,5,1,"you go back to work tomorrow night, right?",
10,1,5,3,"so if you want people to see them, then by definition you're not having them taken out... say, at the break of dawn?",
10,1,5,5,what are you singing?,
10,1,5,7,"it's ""ride of the valkyries"" from ""apocalypse now""... see, here's the thing the corn rose were really a solution to your frizzy hair problem. and now that we're home, we don't have that problem anymore, so if you think about it... i hate them!",
10,1,5,9,did i? let's refresh. i believe what i said was that i could see your scalp.,
10,1,5,11,"again, let's journey back... as i recall what rachel said, was she had never notice the shape of your skull before. and joey... well, joey didn't realise that there was anything different.",
10,1,5,13,hit yourself in the tooth?,

10,2,9,11,see? intuitive!,
10,2,9,14,which technically now you should give back!,
10,2,9,16,"i'm so sorry, but you should have a sign out there or something. or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door. ""owen doesn't know he's adopted, and he also thinks that santa is real.""",

10,4,3,109,they left.,[monica turns to see the closed door.]
10,4,5,1,"i'm sorry, is this a game for emma or for monica?",
10,4,5,3,"emma, you even know it's your birthday today? you're one! one-year-old, that's little.",[with his index finger he shows her how old she is. emma also points her finger and babbles...]

10,4,5,14,"no, not yet.",
10,4,5,22,"hey, guys! come on! you gotta see what emma just did.",
10,4,5,24,"emma, how old are you? how old are you today?",[holds up his index finger again]
10,4,5,33,"let's do it, come on!",[rachel wipes away some tears.]
10,5,1,6,thanks!,
10,5,1,9,"joey, we would've asked you, we just thought you wouldn't be interested.",
10,5,1,16,so excited about your letter!,[phoebe enters]

10,5,1,29,that's where people make number two!!,
10,5,6,1,i don’t... uh... understand.,[reading]
10,5,6,5,on every word?,
10,5,6,9,and that became ‘they are humid prepossessing homo sapiens with full sized aortic pumps...?,
10,5,6,14,"you know what? you don’t need a thesaurus, just write from here, your full sized aortic pump.",[points at his own heart]
10,5,9,1,i doubt that! tell her about us last year.,

10,5,9,28,sounds good to me... but what would a guy think?,[amy walks in carrying a phone handset]
10,5,10,0,hey joe! how's the second draft of the letter coming?,
10,5,10,4,can we read it? can you print out another copy?,

10,5,10,13,they loved it.,[still looks confused]
10,5,10,15,they thought it was very smart of us to have a child write the recommendation letter.,
10,5,10,17,"she guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings",[amy comes in with emma in a stroller]
10,5,10,21,that sounds like fun.,
10,5,10,31,i think she looks cute. ... but i am wrong!,[rachel turns around and stares at him angrily]
10,5,10,36,d chandler hi ross.,
10,5,10,41,like war. or that thing in joey's refrigerator. remember? it was in a milk carton but it looked like meat?,

10,6,2,10,"first of all. bravo. uh, but i really don't think you're right for this. the part calls for a stuffy college professor.",
10,6,2,12,software that facilitates inter-business networking e-solutions?,
10,6,5,0,hey you guys.,
10,6,5,3,"joe, i told you, you're just not right for the part.",

10,6,5,11,"work, joe!",
10,6,5,13,what am i gonna do now?,[to rachel]
10,6,5,15,"he's not right for the part. so if i suggest him, my bosses are gonna think i'm an idiot! and that's something they should learn on their own!",
10,6,5,17,"that's good! i liked it, they didn't. joey, for god's sake, go to work! .",[he sees joey out of the window hitting on a girl] [joey runs away]
10,6,8,0,hey joe!,

10,6,8,8,what!? of course i did!,[looks surprised]
10,6,8,10,"i'm not lying to you, i watched it!",
10,6,8,12,i watched it!,
10,6,8,14,i did!,[now yelling] [pretending to look shocked]
10,6,8,16,"i'm telling you, i watched the tape.",[following him] [reaches joey's room and joey slams the door in his face]
10,6,8,18,no!,"[in a sarcastic ""of course not""!-tone]"
10,6,10,0,i can't believe joey. i hate being called a liar!,
10,6,10,2,what did i just say?,[joey comes out of his room]
10,6,10,4,"yes, and i have to say, i am not just hurt. i am insulted. when i tell somebody i did something...",
10,6,10,6,why are you so sure i didn't watch this tape?,
10,6,10,12,he really is a chameleon.,
10,6,14,0,"look, i'm sorry i didn't give them your tape. and i promise, next time to submit you whether i think you are right for the part or not.",
10,6,14,2,i know. you're right. what's it gonna take for you to forgive me?,
10,6,15,3,lying is wrong!,
10,6,15,5,i'm a pretty little girl.,
10,7,1,4,"that's funny, we were doing the same thing!",
10,7,1,7,"yeah it is really pricey. i mean, i freaked when i first heard the numbers.",
10,7,1,9,"it was pretty simple actually, i came up with a couple of cost-cutting solutions, wrote out a list and monica told me to go to hell.",
10,7,1,18,maybe you do that next time you get married!,[to ross]
10,7,2,1,hey!,
10,7,2,3,our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning the apartment.,
10,7,2,5,you know you don't want me to help. you can't have it both ways!,

10,7,2,10,little people?,[pointing at himself]
10,7,2,13,what...? no!,
10,7,2,15,"i don't, and i'm offended by the insinuation!",[he stands up and he feels very offended]
10,7,2,17,"i'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine, but that tape is not mine.",
10,7,5,1,"ok, ok, here we go.",
10,7,5,3,here we go. stand up straight. big smile.,[smiling] [opens the door and both are smiling exaggeratedly]
10,7,5,16,but you already gave all your money to charity!,
10,7,5,18,i don’t think you can do that!,
10,7,5,20,"that’s sweet, honey, but save something for the adoption lady.",
10,7,8,6,"oh, because we love kids. love ‘em to death.well, not actually to death, that's just a figure of speech - we love kids the appropriate amount... as allowed by law.",
10,7,8,11,"but other than that... wholesome, wholesome building.",
10,7,8,13,what?,
10,7,8,19,of course it was!,

10,7,8,27,"oh, it's just some crazy guy who roams the halls here. he's great with kids though.",
10,7,10,1,aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa......aaaaaa-doption!!,[screams to interrupt joey]
10,7,10,3,"oh, just like i said. that crazy... bert... roaming the halls.",[joey bangs on the door again]
10,7,10,7,"we'll talk to you later, bert. everythng's fine!!","[cut to joey on the other side, who finally leaves the door and goes to his apartment]"
10,7,10,10,oh yeah! he has a caretaker. his older brother... ernie.,
10,7,10,12,you can't make this stuff up!,[nervous smile]
10,7,12,1,what the hell are you doing?,
10,7,12,3,"well, we're not.",
10,7,12,5,we don't have a code word.,
10,7,12,9,any room that isn't behind this couch!,[laughs nervously]
10,7,12,12,"you have to get out of here. you slept with our social worker and you never called her back and she is still pissed, so she can't see you.",[escorting joey to the door]
10,7,12,14,ok!,"[joey leaves and closes the door behind him. chandler walks towards the living room, but then joey enters again.]"
10,7,12,15,what?,
10,7,12,18,"and for the last time, we do not want to be friends with you! and we don't want to buy your bat!",[joey lowers his bat]
10,7,12,22,i can explain... joey...,
10,7,12,35,"oh, that's really ok.",
10,7,14,1,wrong number?,
10,7,14,3,that's great!,
10,7,14,5,hello...? have you seen joey's bat? commercial break,
10,8,1,4,yeah. we don't feel like we can host thanksgiving this year.,
10,8,1,8,"well, it's just with uhm, work and the stress of adoption, we just don't feel like we have the energy. plus , we don't think it's fair that every year the burden falls on us.",
10,8,1,10,"no, no! we made this decision together.",
10,8,1,22,don't let yourself get manipulated this way!,
10,8,1,24,we are supposed to make these decisions together! did you not watch the doctor phil i taped for you?,
10,8,3,1,why come all the way from kansas to do that?,
10,8,3,3,"you know what just occurred to me? this could be our last thanksgiving just the two of us. i mean, we could be getting a baby soon!",
10,8,3,5,somebody is gonna pick us.,
10,8,3,7,"i'm telling ya! it's gonna happen. next year it's gonna be you, me and the little hemingway bing. what, he's my favourite author!",[pause]
10,8,3,9,"""the firm""?",[after a long pause]
10,8,3,11,"you know, you always cook this meal all by yourself. let me help this year.",
10,8,3,13,"i'm serious, let me do something, just not the turkey or the stuffing, nothing ""high profile"".",
10,8,3,15,tell me more.,
10,8,3,17,you obviously haven't tasted my palmolive potatoes!,[ross and joey enter]
10,8,3,22,oh my god!,
10,8,3,27,"hmm, the game's at one.",
10,8,3,29,"dinner is at four, we'll never gonna make it back.",
10,8,3,31,"you say that now, but it could take us a long time to get back home. plus joey could get lost and and they could have to page us to go pick him up.",
10,8,3,33,"look, monica has been working hard all day, she didn't wanna host this thing in the first place, we shouldn't go!",
10,8,3,36,okay. and get ready to taste my very special cranberries. or should i say... chanberries!,[pause]
10,8,6,1,i can't believe they are not here! i slave and i slave for what? they've ruined cranberry day!,
10,8,8,1,they're out there!,[peeping]
10,8,8,3,"everything is so distorted! looks like joey has a giant hand! which says ""rangers"" on it. they went to the game!",[peeping]
10,8,8,5,ross' shirt is torn.,[looking through the peephole again]
10,8,8,31,"yeah, and there's a bowl of cranberry sauce that... what happens to cranberry sauce?",[speaking lower to monica]
10,8,8,33,oh thank god!,[relieved] [cut to the hall]
10,8,8,35,"that's a lie, you went to the game, i can see joey's hand.",[looking through the peephole]
10,8,8,46,"guys, i'd listen to her. the vein is bigger than i've ever seen it.",[monica looks at chandler] [cut to the hall] [rachel comes out of the apartment holding a pot. joey holds in anticipation and rachel opens it]
10,8,8,49,ha-ha! all you got was monica's stinky brussels sprouts!,
10,8,8,51,please let me stay on this side of the door.,[cut to hall]
10,8,8,61,the cranberries...?,
10,8,8,64,"he's doing that weird eye contact thing. don't look at him, don't look at him!",[they both look away]
10,8,8,69,the floating heads do make a good point.,
10,8,8,82,"well, you manheads aren't any better. you lied about going to the game. you knew it would make you late, and you still went anyway.",
10,8,8,88,that would be a lot more convincing if you weren't drooling.,
10,8,8,105,a little late for that,
10,8,8,108,"uhm, we've got turkey grease.",
10,8,8,118,can you ever feel your ears?,
10,8,8,121,"oh, i left them on my bulldozer... i don't have tools!",[sarcastically]
10,8,8,132,"okay, look, i'm gonna pull on the door and you guys push as hard as you can. maybe we can get enough room to wiggle him out, okay? okay, so push!",
10,8,8,135,"come on guys, push!",
10,8,8,137,chandler push! push! push!,"[the chain breaks loose from the wall, and because joey was pushing with all his might, he propells into the kitchen, towards the table with all the food. this table has wheels underneath it, and when joey falls on this table, he rides into the living room, with all the food falling off, until finally joey also falls off... joey gets up quickly, a bit agitated, and acting as nothing happened. he is covered in food stains.]"
10,8,8,138,my cranberries!,
10,8,8,140,argh! i can't believe what you did. monica's gonna kill you!,[monica enters from the spare bedroom.]
10,8,8,141,look! look! look what the... look what... look what the floating heads did!,[to monica]
10,8,8,143,what's going on?,
10,8,8,145,and?,
10,8,8,147,are you serious?,[they hug]
10,8,9,7,that is the exact same thing.,
10,9,1,0,hi!,
10,9,1,3,"we're just here to say goodbye, we're off to ohio.",
10,9,1,7,and so incorrect!,
10,9,1,10,"uhm, thank you, but we're really trying not to get our hopes up.",
10,9,1,12,"yeah. i mean, this girl could decide against adoption or she could like another couple better..",
10,9,1,14,i can develop a condition in which i talk and talk and no one hears a word.,
10,9,1,17,so we're standing firm on the 'not getting our hopes up'?,
10,9,1,19,"yes, but...",
10,9,1,21,"oh, screw it, i'm gonna be a daddy!!",
10,9,3,2,"yeah. just weird, you know. it's like ""hi, i'm chandler. may i have the human growing inside you?""",
10,9,3,4,you're gonna be great.,
10,9,3,9,thank you so much for agreeing to see us.,
10,9,3,12,ok.,
10,9,3,14,that's what our friends call us.,
10,9,3,18,i don't think that's exactly...,[astonished]
10,9,6,0,"so, the fact that i am a doctor, and my wife’s a reverend, that’s important to you?",
10,9,6,3,plus i thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor!,
10,9,6,8,"yeah, wow.",
10,9,6,12,no-ot for me it doesn’t.,[the agency guy enters the room]
10,9,6,16,"yeah, actually. so, you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us?",
10,9,6,18,you should be. you’re really on top of stuff..,
10,9,6,24,"yeah, i did.",
10,9,9,0,we are not signing those papers.,
10,9,9,2,it's wrong. they made a mistake. they think we're somebody else.,
10,9,9,4,you have gotta stop!,
10,9,9,6,she likes doctor chandler and reverend monica.,
10,9,9,8,"your veal chop is $34,95!",
10,9,9,10,but we are not the one she chose! how can you feel okay about this?,
10,9,9,12,i know..,
10,9,9,14,"oh, honey..",
10,9,9,16,"monica, i want a baby too, but this woman is giving away her child. she deserves to know who it's going to.",
10,9,9,18,"so, we'll tell the truth and who knows, maybe she'll like us for us.",
10,9,9,20,you're jewish.,
10,9,13,2,hey.,
10,9,13,8,the agency must have made some mistake. my wife is not a reverend and i'm not a doctor.,
10,9,13,11,i could perform an operation on you and prove it if you'd like.,
10,9,13,14,"well, our names really are monica and chandler. we're from new york.",
10,9,13,23,erica wait!,
10,9,13,25,you have every reason to be upset. we did lie. but only because we've been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long. now we don't know how long it's gonna be before we can get another chance again.,
10,9,13,27,"erica, please. just consider us. ask them to see our file. our last name's bing. my wife's a chef and i'm in advertising.",
10,9,13,29,"but you did like us. and you should. my wife's an incredible woman. she's loving and devoted and caring. and don't tell her i said this but the woman's always right... i love my wife more than anything in this world. and i... it kills me that i can't give her a baby... i really want a kid. and when that day finally comes, i'll learn how to be a good dad. but my wife... she's already there. she's a mother... without a baby... please?",[they look at each other. we switch back to monica. chandler opens the door and she turns to look at him.]
10,9,13,30,you still want that baby?,"[monica plays those words back in her mind and then smiles and runs to chandler, who is twisting with joy. they hug.]"
10,10,1,5,"seriously, answer faster!",[looking at her]
10,10,1,7,it's like a giant hug.,[to phoebe]
10,10,2,14,hello.,[picking up the phone]

10,10,3,4,"well, at least the perfume is not mine, be thankful for that!",
10,10,3,6,it’s perfect. it’s everything we’ve been looking for.,
10,10,3,8,and the wiggle wharms and the zip zorps? what were the things you said?,[pause]
10,10,3,10,and the fireplace in the bedroom.,
10,10,3,12,this is bringing out a lovely color in you!,

10,10,3,16,i do too.,
10,10,3,18,i know.,
10,10,3,20,"i don’t know what you mean, giant talking cigarette! oh, by the way, phoebe called just as i was getting into nancy’s car, so if she asks you, i was at work all day.",
10,10,3,22,"we don’t. not until it's a hundred percent. i mean, why upset everybody over nothing.",
10,10,3,24,i know. gooooood luck with it.,
10,10,5,14,hey!,
10,10,5,16,"is it me, or have the greetings gone downhill around here?",
10,10,5,21,yeah i'm not having an affair. nancy is our realtor.,[motions them to sit and they do]
10,10,5,33,...and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by.,
10,10,5,39,"actually, we already found a house we love.",
10,10,5,42,"bet you wish i was having an affair now, huh? time lapse",
10,10,5,46,i know this is really hard and we're really sorry.,
10,10,5,48,you know that's not the reason joe.,"[goes towards joey] [joey hugs him and after, he takes something from the fridge and puts it in his mouth. he goes back to where he was standing before]"
10,10,5,62,"hey, that's...'joincidence' with a 'c'!","[from 1.07 - ""the one with the blackout""]"

10,10,5,126,"well, i think, i think ross knows about me and monica.",

10,10,5,152,sure!,
10,10,5,154,"little toast here. i know this isn't exactly the kind of thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, i think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. anyway, i was just thinking, i mean, if you'd gone to vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? so i guess what i'm trying to say is that i'm very thankful that all of your thanksgivings sucked.",
10,10,5,158,"here, here!",
10,10,6,5,"hello? it's nancy, they responded to our offer.",
10,10,6,7,"okay, thanks... they passed. they said they wouldn't go a penny under the asking price.",[to nancy] [to monica]

10,12,7,1,"hey, can i talk to you about this groomsman thing? if you pick ross, he'll walk you down the isle just fine. but if you choose me, you'll be getting some comedy!",
10,12,7,3,"let me tell you why you need to pick me. see, when i was a kid, i was always left out of everything, you know, and it really made me feel... insecure. you know, i was always picked last in gym. even behind that big fat exchange student who didn't even know the rules to baseball. i mean, this guy would strike out and then run to third. anyway, if i'm the only one left out of this wedding, i just know that all those feelings are gonna come rushing back.",[goes to sit on the couch facing backwards to the kitchen. rachel gets a chair and sits opposite him]

10,12,9,15,i'll tell you at the wedding.,
10,12,11,6,"so technically, would this person be in the wedding?",

10,13,2,4,"oh, hey, when she gets here, is it ok if i introduce you two as ""my wife"" and ""the woman who's carrying my child""? no? divorce?",[she's not amused]
10,13,2,17,"oh, those places! there's always so many people, their being corralled like cattle, and... you know, there's always some idiot who goes ""mooooo""!",
10,13,2,25,i'm so sorry...,

10,13,7,27,"i dunno, aren't there tests for these things, right?",
10,13,7,29,"pff, easy for you to say, he's a father killer. he probably loves him mommy. he's probably got a tattoo that says ""mom"" on his shovel-wielding arm!",
10,13,10,0,hey! how was lunch?,
10,13,10,2,"oh, really?",[struggling]
10,13,10,4,"o-okay. so, is she gonna take the test?",[steps closer to monica and speaks softly]

10,17,12,11,"it's okay, it's just an egg roll.",
10,17,12,16,"okay, let's find these birds.",
10,17,12,20,"well, that can't be good!",

10,17,12,37,did that movie ever get made?,
10,17,18,1,"and we're also gonna buy you tiny, bird hearing-aids.",[joey picks up a hammer and a crowbar and gets ready to destroy the table.]
10,17,18,3,what's the matter?,
10,17,18,5,i understand.,
10,17,18,7,"i don't know. except that, for one last time... good game, good game, good game, good game, good game, good game, good game.",[he touches the players as he says the following]
10,17,18,9,"well, i can't do it either.",[monica enters.]
10,17,18,12,"we have to bust it open, but neither of us can do it!",
10,17,20,1,that was... impressive.,
10,17,20,4,"sorry about the table, man.",

10,17,20,8,"well, at least we got these little guys out.",
10,17,20,10,"aww, we were worried about you! hm. i guess i better get used to things crapping in my hand, huh?",
10,17,20,12,"hey, you know what? maybe we should keep them here with you.",
10,17,20,14,"yeah, i mean we've got a lot going on right now. and, plus, here they'd have their own room.",
10,17,20,16,"you know, i - i think you're set with the poultry.",
10,17,20,18,"i think there may be another reason. so, awkward hug or lame cool guy handshake?",
10,17,22,1,"wow, this is weird.",
10,17,22,10,where's ross?,
10,17,24,5,"look around, you guys. this was your first home. and it was a happy place, filled with love and laughter. but more important, because of rent control, it was a friggin' steal!",[to his children] [monica and chandler put jack and erica in their stroller.]
10,17,24,12,"oh, okay.",[chandler and monica walk over to the kitchen-counter and leave their keys. then the other four pick out their keys and leave them as well.]
10,17,24,16,"oh, it's gonna be okay.",[chandler hugs her. monica hugs ross and rachel as chandler gets the stroller with the twins.]
10,17,24,20,sure. where?,"[they all leave the apartment. joey helps chandler with the stroller in the hallway, while monica and rachel have their arms around each other. everybody walks downstairs to central perk. the camera goes inside the apartment again, and it pans around. we see the keys on the counter, and the final shot is of the frame around the peephole. the screen fades to black.]"
