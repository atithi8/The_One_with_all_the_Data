i know monica's worst thanksgiving.,and rachel oh no.,"yeah, yeah, it’ll be great! you can, you can lay on the beach and i can cry over my failed marriage. see-see how i make jokes?","oh, no, no, no, it’s-it’s not the lecture ah, i mind, umm...."

ed rachel not for me. chip and i broke up!,what?,okay!,"well, i’m sorry, but ah, look if you’re not working with him anymore, why do you have to still do stuff with him?"
"ed rachel well, you know that my parents are out of town and chip was going to come over…",you mean the mom you met in montauk. she was a cat?!,cool!,"okay, but do you really need another friend? i mean..."
"ed rachel okay, monica, can you just call it sex?! it really creeps me out when you call it that! okay, and by the way, while we're at it, a guy's thing is not called his tenderness. believe me! hi!","umm, when were you gonna tell me that you’re going out with chip matthews?",come on! here.,is that funny? am i supposed to be laughing?
ed rachel happy thanksgiving!,nooo! it’s not okay! i can’t believe you would want to after what he did to me!,ah! ah! i forgot my jacket!,pa-haa!! i would love to go with you.
"ed rachel oh! no, not really.",monica! i couldn’t find him for two hours! he was having sex with amy welch!,you tell them to wait!,"yeah, hey i-i have clothes, i even pick them out. i mean for, for all you know i could be a fashion..... monger."
ed rachel ugh! i cannot believe chip dumped me for that slut nancy branson. i am never going out with him again. i don't care how much he begs!,"i mean why, of all people would you want to go out with chip?!",emily.,"what should i wear, now i’m all nervous."
"ed rachel y'know what? i've just had it with high school boys! they are just silly. silly, stupid boys! i'm going to start dating men!","okay, that doesn’t help me, because we went to the same high school.",oh no-no-no! oh-no! no! no! emily!,i’m really glad we came. you’re so pretty. i love you.
ed rachel guess what?! all that stuff about nancy branson being a slut was all a rumor so chip dumped her and he wants to come over to my house tonight!,they had to have that specially made?!,hey!,so i nodded off a little.
ed rachel i know!,"oh my god, they told us that was for the mascot!",yeah!,come on! forty-five minutes! forty-five minutes the man talked about strappy backed dresses.
"ed rachel oh totally, totally. y'know it's not that big of deal, we already kinda did it once y'know.","oh, you go out with him.",ohh…,"first of all it’s professor pittain! and second of all, that little bone, proved that, that particular dinosaur had wings, but didn’t fly."
"ed rachel i know, i know. and oh, and this time chip promised that-that this time it will last at least for an entire song!","yeah. just, if it’s possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy?","y'know, i think they have those at that british pub near the trade center.","y'know what, 100 million people went to see a movie about what i do, i wonder how many people would go see a movie called, jurassic parka."
"actually, y'know that's not the thanksgiving i was talking about.",i believe it.,isn't rachel supposed to be back by now?,"no-no-no, a bunch of out of control jackets take over an island."
"no, it wasn't. it was actually the…","yes, i do.","oh, so-so you talked to her. did she, did she sound mad?","no. i... i wanted to be with you. i don’t know, i feel like lately, i feel like you’re slipping away from me, y'know. with this new job, and all these new people, and you’ve got this whole other life going on. i-i-i know it’s dumb, but i hate that i’m not a part of it."
"oh, yeah, i had too. there was never any parking by the psychology building.","oh sure i am, because you always have to be right.","okay, i did not abandon rachel! okay? emily showed up at the airport! i had to go after her! i mean, i-i did what i had to do! she's my wife! rachel is my wife! y'know— emily ! emily, is my wife! man, what is that?",that’s a little clearer.
oh hi!,jurassic park could happen.,"no, not since i lost her at the airport.","sure, i-i-i..."
"no, god! please, let me!","you guys, you’re never gonna believe what i just found tacked up on a telephone pole! look kinda familiar?","hey, she's fast!! okay?!! oh! you-you think you can be beat me? let's go! outside!!",is everything okay?
hey!,"you guys, there’s a little girl in soho looking for this cat. i mean, you know what that means?!","rach, rach, i am so sorry. i am so-so sorry.","hey, how’d the date go with mr. millionaire?"
"oh-ho, my god! that was so awesome! you totally got him back for calling you fat! he was just drooling all over you. that must've felt so great!",do we have to tell her?,"that's it? you're not mad? i mean, it must've been terrible.",still?!
what?!,i hate when ross is right!,"so, what? that's it?",i guess he musta gotten the part in that play.
"okay, that we may be able to do.",pheebs...,"oh, thanks. oh, you're the best.",hello.
well guys tend to get naked before they're gonna have sex.,all right!!,"ohh, i gotta go to the flower store! check it out, no one will tell me where emily is, so i'm gonna send 72 long-stem, red roses to emily's parent's house, one for each day that i've known and loved her. that oughta get her talking to me again.",so rachel called. wants to see me. going over in a minute.
"okay, first of all, if you keep calling it that, no one's gonna ever take it. then, second of all you're not actually gonna have sex with him! you're just gonna make him think that you are.",jeez!,hi.,"well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life without me.... a-sucks."
yeah.,"hello, chip.",she's doing her laundry.,then be supportive like a guy.
"then, you will definitely get him back!","i’m great! i’m great. i’ve got a great job at bloomingdale’s , have wonderful friends, and eventhough i’m not seeing anyone right now, i’ve never felt better about myself.","it came in the mail today, it's uh, 72 long-stemmed red roses, one for each day that i've known and loved emily, cut up into mulch!",hi.

"joey, do you have a minute?","no! it didn’t! that’s what i want to talk to you about. now, just to brief you… i may cry, but they are not tears of sadness or of anger, but just of me having this discussion with you.","and while that was good advice, you should know that what-what she wants…","come on you guys, it's no big deal!"
"oh, joey, i have such a problem!",there’s nobody here!,…is for me not to see you anymore.,well what is it? is it a mole?
"okay. okay. okay. joey, i have got to tell you something!",do you want me to quit?,"it's awful i know, i mean, i feel terrible but i have to do this if i want my marriage to work. and i do, i have to make this marriage work. i have too. but the good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here.","well, eww. what? is it a pimple?"
"oh my god, it's so huge, but you just have to promise me that you cannot tell anyone.","well of those things that you said in the interview, i mean if you believe any of them, i must not be a very good assistant. y’know what? i am just gonna pack up my desk, and i will be gone by the end of the day! well, i guess there’s no use to me sticking around ‘til the end of the day!",you have no idea what a nightmare this has been. this is so hard.,ahhh.
"yes! yes! yes, you do want to know! this is unbelievable!",what?,what are you doing?,hey guys!
what? what secrets? you know secrets? what are they?,my drinking?,"rachel, this is your apartment.","well, he said there's definitely nothing to worry about, it's totally benign."
"i know, i know! i just can't keep this one in, so i pick up the phone…",said what? exactly.,you should've seen the look on her face. i don't want rachel to hate me! i don't know what to do.,"he couldn't even tell me! he said it was just some sort of skin... abnormality. and the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify it, he was reluctant to remove it."
that really is something; that's really cool.,"oh my god!! ohh, that is it! i’m leaving! you are just a horrible person!",yes! please!,"at least they knew what yours was. y'know, yours had a name."
"good luck, honey!",say more things like that.,that's okay.,"yeah, that'd be cool!"
"hey, uh, joey?",i’d need an expense account.,that's not advice!,"th-th-that's all it is, a third nipple. y'know? just your run-of-the-mill third nipple. y'know? you can take it off. just slice that baby right off!"
remember that big thing i was gonna tell you about?,and an assistant.,i'm going to the bathroom.,just showing you my run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off third nipple.
"i'm not gonna tell you, but if you found out on your own, that would be okay and then we could talk about it. right?","hey mon, little question for ya! how do you think this suit will look on an assistant buyer?","pheebs, you mind if i speak to rachel alone for a sec?",no?
"yeah. well. hey uh joe, would mind going over to chandler's bedroom and get that book back that he borrowed from me?","oh my god!! you just ruined the thing i was practicing the whole way home, but i’m soo happy!",hi.,"well then, what is it?!"
yeah!,"ohh, you’ve waited soo long.","i talked to monica, look, i'm the one who made the choice. i'm the one who's making things change, so i should be the one to y'know, step back.",y'know i have dinner plans!!
do you know something?,"hey, pheebs, quick question for ya.","no, no, it's okay. really. they're plenty of people who just see their sisters at thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see joey at burger king . so is, is that better?","yes, and the dimmer switch."
i might know something too.,how do you think this suit would look on an assistant buyer at bloomingdale’s ?,"well, what-what would you do? rach, if you were me, what-what would you do?","hey, you gotta get mom on the phone. call mom! call mom!"
"oh no, i can't tell you until you tell me what you know.",yes!!!,i can't believe this is happening.,monica’s right. we’re talking about getting married here. okay? she-she can’t just rush into this.
well then i can't tell you what i know.,"ohh, it’s gonna be so great! i’m gonna get to help decide what we sell, i’m gonna have an office with walls and everything. i’m gonna have walls!",i am so sorry.,"thank you, but i want to remove it pheebs. i don’t want to make it savory."
"all right, how about i go over there and i will walk into chandler's bedroom and i will see that thing that i think that i know is actually the thing that i think that i know!",i’m an assistant buyer!!,i couldn't possibly eat another bite.,gimme this.
and you know!!!,"oh, hi mrs. lynch! is joanna in already?","huh, i don't know what to pick. am i more thankful for my divorce or my eviction? hmm.",hi.
"chandler and monica?!! oh, this is unbelievable!! how long have you known?",heard what?,i'm sorry. it's just that this is the worse thanksgiving ever.,"listen, i got to tell you i’ve-i’ve never been to a guru before, so..."
hey!,oh my god! how?!,"oh god, no.",what’s a koondis?
"ohhh, yeah, me too.","oh my god! oh, i cannot believe it!",you're right. yours is worse. you are the king of bad thanksgivings.,i guess it’s worth a try.
i'd say from the looks of it; our naked buddy is moving.,"oh, god. oh, god. oh god.","in this life, phoebe.",what?! what?!
"ohh, i'm gonna miss that big old squishy butt.","yes, so close. mrs. lynch, i know that this is an emotional and difficult time, for all of us. but by any chance did joanna send any paperwork your way before… it happened.",yeah that's the same.,we?! we angered it?!
well that is because your eye immediately goes to the big naked man.,"yes-yes, just a few seconds and she’d still be with us—nothing about an assistant buyer?",hey!,oh god!
"well, i never thought i'd say this, but i'm gonna go use ugly naked guy's bathroom.","oh, sophie, i guess you didn’t hear about joanna…","uh, everyone, this is chandler! my roommate and lead singer of our band!",ow!!
what?!,"hey, y’know, at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with! i hate being alone this time of year! next thing you know it’ll be valentine’s day, then my birthday, then bang!—before you know it, they’re lighting that damn tree again. ohh, i want somebody! y’know, i want a man !! i mean, it doesn’t even have to be a big relationship, y’know, just like a fling would be great.","oh, this is monica.","what was, what was that?"
oh my god!,"well, believe me, it’s been a long time since i’ve been flung.","oh, mom. mom. chandler hates thanksgiving and doesn't eat any thanksgiving food.",what?! how’s that?
oh my god!!!,"yeah! wait a minute, it’s been a long time that i’ve been single. how come you never offered this before?","so uh, rach? does it, does it feel weird around here now? y'know since i've been away at college.",hey!
phoebe!! phoebe!! it's okay!! it's okay!!,"okay! no accountants. oh, and no one from like legal. i don’t like guys with boring jobs.","well, that's cool. so did…",what happened?
i know!! i know!! i know!,"hey, honey! what’s the matter? fine, i was just trying to be nice! whoa!","umm, i'm sorry judy, i couldn't find that bowl that you and jack were looking for.","yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking."
"yes, i know! and joey knows! but ross doesn't know so you have to stop screaming!!","well, wait a minute, you’re the boss! why don’t you just yell at them? or, fire them?",monica!,"huh, what’s fish hooking... thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. what is that taste?"

what's going on?,"why? honey, what is the big deal?","uh-huh. well, when the psychiatrist told me i had to take a leave of absence because i yelled at my boss i started to get worked up again, so he offered me a tranquilizer. and i thought was a good idea so, i took it.","you didn’t tell her?! okay, fine! pheebs?"
ross! we broke up two years ago; you've been married since then. i think it's okay that we see other people.,"yeah, that’s true.","i don't know. it's going to be weird not having a job for a while, but i, i definitely don't care about my sandwich.","hi! listen uhh, this cat belongs to a little girl. there are flyers all over the place."

here you go. thank you!,hi!,this is not good for my rage.,"come here, here, come here, come here, mrs. buffay. sorry, about what i said, umm, it was, it was insensitive of me to say that you were just a cat. when clearly you are also the reincarnated spirit, of my friend’s mother."
"oh what, you-you want both of them?","so i was with joshua for an hour today, and he has not asked me out. it’s just so frustrating!",my god monica!!,"oh! y'know, i’ve got an extra futon."

pick one.,"ooh, pheebs, what are you gonna say? are you gonna tell him who you are?","i tired attacking two women, did not work.","well, but aren't you pissed at him?! i mean this guy abandoned you! i gotta tell you if this were me, this guy would be in some serious physical danger! i mean i-i-i'd walk in there and i'd be like, ""yo, dad! you and me outside right now!"" i kinda scared myself."
you’re welcome.,what?! why? joey you were so ready for it!,"no, i mean it’s okay, i mean, they’re-they’re my friends. in fact, i-i-i was married to one of them.","well, maybe he just didn't want to hurt your feelings."
joey! we should just switch.,"honey wait, joey, i’m sorry i mean as terrific as i think you are with it…","oh, no! no-no! no, i tired! but i couldn’t. that’s why i’m here. maybe we could attack them together? that-that’s a no.",what kind of problem?
"ohhh, this is the least jealous i’ve ever been!",…i just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.,"ah-ha, nowhere to run!",nooooo!
"oh hell, he’s done this three times! he knows what its about!","wait a minute! wait a minute! i'm not saying that you shouldn’t have a bag, i just—it's just there are other bags that are a little less umm, controversial.",danger !!!!,hi!
oh my god! this is it! i really hope it’s you!,"okay, gotta go! wish me luck!",hey!,"well, it's not for sure but umm, we met this guy in the park who thought ben was really cute--y'know, which he is--so umm anyhoo, he uh, he gave us his card and told us to bring him down for this commercial he's auditioning."
me too!,"uh well, y'know what? i don't think if i feel comfortable stealing on my very first day…",thanks? but i have plans; elizabeth and i are going out of town.,"i know, it's crazy! we were just pushing ben on the swings…"
"okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! who is it?!","okay guys, way to wish me luck!",yeah.,okay!!
hypothetically!,"well umm, that one is pretty but uh, i just, i just love this fabric sorry.",why? what?,"all right, i gotta take off. i'm picking up ben then we're off to the big audition."
uh-hmm.,"oh, what a fun office.","no, no, that’s funny. but maybe it’s time to move on, let it go, y’know? stop it! besides, rachel is going out with elizabeth’s father, so ah, he’s much older than she is. looks like i’m not the only one interested in fossils, huh?",yeah.
yeah that’s actually a pretty good idea.,"oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror stories… …about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke.","okay, okay. uh, well uh, rachel is going to need to yell sweet nothings in his ear.",yeah the dad and ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it.
"well of course we will help you decide! we will do anything we can to help you! now, i would like to make a toast, to the future mrs. chandler bing , my best friend, and truly one of the nicest people that…",…and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the decisions without me!,"oh, come on you guys; that’s funny! y’know? because he’s need—he’s got like a hearing aide y’know, ‘cause-‘cause y’know, ‘cause he’s all old, and…",you're not his godfather.
fine!,"i know! it's like i'm being punished for not having this disgusting, poisoning habit!","really? that okay, that’s great.","of course i am! okay, let's go godfather."
yeah?,"i mean what if this keeps happening? y'know, they'll-they'll be outside smoking, making all the decisions and i'll just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air, y'know? and then when the day comes when kim wants to promote one of us, who do you think she's gonna pick? me or smokey smokerson?","all right look, i-i realize it upsets you.",really? that's great!
really?!,"yeah, i can do that.","but, elizabeth and i are-are both adults and so i don’t think there’s really anything you can do about it.","yeah well, he's not gonna get this one. ben is way cuter than that kid. i mean look at him, look at you,"
oh my god phoebe! i mean i’m just—wait a minute. if i’m your maid of honor that means you are monica’s.,i would love to!,ohh! a man with a plan!,"joey, you look nothing like ben."
ohh! no way phoebe! i want to be monica’s!,"oh well, it's kinda lonely up there, so i just thought i would come out here and get some fresh air.",this place is really beautiful!,hi.
why does it matter so much to you?!,oh great!,"wow! the only thing i got from my grandmother was her eyes. i mean not-not her actual eyeballs, but, but people say that my eyes—do-do you want to make out?",not so good.
what-what if i marry ross—or joey?,oh that's okay.,"ehh, i was just, i was just thinking about your father.","yeah i am! yeah, ben got a second audition!"

…it’s gonna be okay!,"yeah, i did, but y'know what? i am really, really trying to cut back, y'know? good luck, rach.",did you really hear a bear?,"why should ben step aside? it was his audition in the first place! you-you just tagged along! you're like the uh, tag-a-long dad."
"look monica, getting cold feet is very common. y’know, it’s-it’s just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love chandler. and also, i ran out on a wedding. you don’t get to keep the gifts.",well then let's just quit! we'll just quit! let's all quit!,"elizabeth! okay. okay. i’m gonna go out this window. i’ll meet you at the front door. just tell them you’re going home, okay?",what?!
thanks!,oh but you could. you can. absolutely! we can help each other out! we can get--what are those--those patches! we could be like the patch sisters!,and that is why we cannot see each other anymore.,and why wouldn't he get it?

"ohh, wait a minute, we haven’t pre…",come on you guys! what are doing?! i thought we were the patch sisters!,god that is the most beautiful engagement ring ever!,joey!
"okay! okay! umm, webster’s dictionary defines marriage as… okay!! forget that! that sucks!! okay, never mind! forget it! umm, umm, okay, uh… i met, i-i met, i met monica when we were just a couple of six year olds and i became friends with chandler when he was 25, although he seemed like a six year old. ross and","well y'know if you, if you started smoking again you could've at least told me! come on, give me one of those! what are we talking about?","yeah, you didn’t get one.","ben! i mean, ben! ben!"
"thank you. thank you very much. umm, i’ve known them separately and i’ve known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love. so i would like to raise my glass to monica and chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together. i can think of no two people better prepared for the journey.","oh wait, no-no-no! drag me down. drag-drag me down.",hey!,hey!
"aw, thanks!",okay.,hey!,"listen man, uh, i'm sorry the audition didn't go so well."

"no! y’know what? no! no! you thing was so stupid anyway, this was ridiculous—we’re gonna flip a coin! all right?! heads!",oh my god! you guys this is so great! i mean it's so unexpected! i mean chandler's birthday is even before mine!,i don’t know.,"i think, sub-consciously…"
"well y’know what? i hope monica forgives you after you throw her, her vegetarian, voodoo, goddess circley shower!",wow! this is great! look at all these cups! this is so weird.,"wait a minute, does-does everyone feel this way?","i think on some level, you-you sabotaged your own audition so that ben would get the part."
hi pheebs.,"oh, okay, not so weird.","uh-uh—wow! uh, i thought you guys were just like making jokes, i had no idea. what you know what? you guys are wrong. uh yes, there is a chronological age difference but i never notice it. you know why? because she is very mature. besides, it doesn’t really matter to me what you guys think. i mean, i’m the one dating elizabeth, not you!",no!

"no. no, you can’t.","ugh, the worse day! y’know, you think you’re making progress at work and then your boss calls you raquel.","yeah, i was but uh, she was a little busy with a water balloon fight.","look, all i know is i-i can’t have another failed marriage!"
oh i don’t-i don’t know.,"i believe you. so, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of course no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me raquel! by the end of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me rocky!","y’know, maybe she is too young for me. y’know, when i was over there and she was running around with her friends, i felt like i was a baby-sitter. i finally started to see what you guys were talking about. i don’t know what to do.","well, okay so, i don’t have it all worked out quite yet. just don’t say anything to rachel, please?"
"yeah actually, i think we’re gonna take off too. we rented a movie.",what?,"okay umm, bad stuff. well, i’m-i’m 12 years older than she is.",hey! hi!

you wanna go in the bedroom? it’s a little more comfortable.,"and chandler, you’re gonna have to watch those long showers you take in the morning because you know raquel can’t be late.","no! no! i…didn’t do that. it’s just… okay, honestly no. i don’t, i don’t see a big future with her.",bye.
"okay. oh wait! umm, did you send those contracts to milan?",ohh! this is so exciting! oh god… come and knock on my door …,"i’ve got to talk to her. ugh, i hate this part.","could ya just, could ya just lay off, please? all right? my life is an embarrassment! i should go live under somebody’s stairs!"
"no seriously, y’know the contracts i gave you, did you overnight them?",hey roomie!,wow! i have never had such a healthy break-up! she was such a grown-up about it! she didn’t seem too immature for me! did i just make a huge mistake?,"no! no, i won’t! i’ll be at the bottom of the dating barrel now. the only guys below me will be four divorce guy uh, murderer guy, and-and, geologists."
okay please tell me that this is just one of your jokes that you do that i don’t get.,are you pregnant?!,"elizabeth, thank god! i was just thinking about…",oh yeah? have you ever dated anyone who has been divorced three times?
"y’know, like the thing when you put the phone in your pants? tag! i’m serious! this isn’t funny! those contracts absolutely had to go out today!",um-hmm.,what?!,what?! why?
"yes i did! and i put a little post-it on it that said, ""must go out today,"" and underlined today three times and, and then i put a little heart in the corner because i didn’t want to seem to bossy.","oh my god! oh, that’s funny, i can’t believe i did that.","okay, break-up’s still on!","and if you wait right here, i’ll go get ross."
"y’know what tag, if we went down to the office you would see those contracts sitting on your desk.",okay.,what happened you guys?,"…once you know the stories, it’s not that bad. first marriage, wife’s hidden sexuality, not my fault. second marriage, said the wrong name at the altar, a little my fault. third marriage, well they really shouldn’t allow you to get married when you’re that drunk and have writing all over your face, nevada’s fault."
or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on the phone with your crotch!,sure? thanks.,rach!,what?!
"no! come on its late, we’re not gonna go down to the office.","monica, where did you get these?!","hey, come on in.","this is crazy! i mean, yes-yes rachel is my good friend and i-i have loved her in the past, but now , she is just my wife! phoebe, will you-will you help me out here?"
okay get your coat! oh! when did you unhook this? nice work!,"ooh, good god, they’re so yummy!","oh, thanks. yeah, i really thought we’d be able to make it work, but uh, i guess it just wasn’t meant to be.","we were drunk! i would’ve married uh, joey with that amount of alcohol!"
"oh how can you possibly know? look at this mess, tag! i mean, this is what i’m talking about! you have to be organized! you’ve got newspapers! you’ve got magazines! you got—ohh! and who is this chippy? a little young for you tag, but whatever.",hey!,i guess so.,"look, i’m sorry, but you guys are wrong. i just don’t want to be divorced three times."
"okay, very cute braces. anyway y’know what, the point is tag, start looking because you are going to find those contracts on your desk.",okay!,right. ohh! you-you want me to be your backup.,"okay! fine! fine! if-if this is what you think, forget about the whole three divorce thing! okay, i-i’ll go to my lawyer’s office right now and get this marriage annulled! okay?! because she means nothing to me! noth— —nothing!!"
"in the afternoon. mr. zelner came into my office after lunch. he put them on my desk, and then i put a post-it on it that said, ""must go out today."" so you just keep looking in there! all right? ",okay.,"ohh, yeah i already have one.",yes.
"puzzler. a bit of a puzzle. why don’t you um, check the copy room, maybe you left the contracts in there?",what the hell is that?,phoebe.,"yes, second in two years. third overall."
i don’t know tag! how can your genitals make phone calls? okay? it’s not a perfect world! just go please.,"wow! mon, thanks! i love this plate!","ohh, i don’t think so.","basically, rachel and i were in vegas and we got drunk…"
thank you. hello? i still don’t get it.,"mon, honey you’re not dying. i’m just moving out. y’know, i mean we’re gonna see each other all the time.","that’s impossible! i mean we have had a deal for years! we-we-we shook on it, although believe me she wanted to do a lot more than that.","yes-yes-yes! but, i-i do not love her."
"hi! i got you some coffee. to, uh… …fair enough. so! do you got anything for me?",are you okay? you’re not blinking.,hey!,this was just a drunken mistake and i need to get it annulled.
oh my god! did you check your entire desk! did you check all the drawers!,"oh, all right. but y’know i gotta say, i don’t, i don’t think six years counts as an era.","phoebe, how could you do this to me?!",i think just the annulment for today.
"well yeah, i wish that you would. well, no it’s not in there! how about that drawer?",what is the matter with you?!,i was not!,easy.
"y’know, i don’t-i don’t know. let me, let me check.","all right, fine, but don’t get mad at me. it’s-it’s just a little hard to believe.",no! pick me! i don’t want to end up an old maid!,no problem.
can i see you in my office for a minute?,"well y’know, it’s you guys. you-you do this kind of stuff! y’know? i mean, you-you were gonna get married in vegas and then you backed out! i guess i’m not upset because i don’t see you guys going through with it. i’m sorry.","ooh, i wanna switch to rachel too!","ooh! there’s no way to do this without her? ‘cause i kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of."
you put these on my desk!,but i…,all right.,"uh-ha, what about someone who looks like rachel? i will think about the therapy."
"oh really? so you’re saying they just slid out of your bottom drawer, crawled across the floor, then jumped on to my desk?!",it is? really?,"joey, we just saw it!",oh no.

"oh, yeah go ahead.",i mean it’s the end of an era!,"dude, you didn’t say die hard . is everything okay?","i… i do, i do not love rachel. i’m gonna tell her right now about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible. okay? would i do that if i loved her?"
no. no.,monica and chandler are really moving in here and i have to move out and everything is changing.,"well, john mclane had plans!",i do not have feelings for rachel! okay?!
"ben, its rachel! but whatever.",thank you.,what happened?!!,"ohh, what’s wrong?!"
"awww, just like his daddy.","pheebs, i wanna ask you something.",we fell asleep! that is all.,oh my—come here! come here! it’s okay. everything’s gonna be okay.

yeah i think so.,you’re just staring into space.,i… i don’t know what you are talking about.,it’s also a sign of friendship.
"bye. ahhh… so this is fun, huh?",this one?,i’ve had better.,it was a hug!
"okay. uh, want something-want something to drink?","pheebs, this whole apartment thing is just a nightmare! every place i can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak. i mean, look at this; ""wanted. female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly."" it’s just, there is nothing! the city’s full!",all right! all right! it was the best nap ever!,s-s-smell her hair? what if i did?

hi!,"yeah. y’know umm, uh, umm, about that, umm, ross i really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything, but don’t you think it’s gonna be weird?","well, technically it seven billion years ago…",what?! over a stupid room!
"well y’know i was just in the neighborhood and i passed by your building and i thought to myself, ""what’s up with carol and sweet, little ben?""","well, because of us! because of our history.","okay! okay! fine, i’ll stop! no teaching, okay? we’ll just watch the pretty light streaking across the sky. okay? who’s official name is bapstein-king.","oh no, yeah no, that part’s great!"
okay.,no?,"man, look at all those stars! infinite space. it really, really makes you wonder, doesn’t it?","what’s all this about you guys fighting?! is this really over a room?! i mean, that is so silly!"
"i’d love that. i would loooove… so uh, so where is sweet little ben? i would love to have a little...",no! not at all!,huh?,"well, apparently not, and i can’t just stand by and watch two people i care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. i mean, enough of the silliness!"
"i found him! very funny, come here! that is exactly why i’ve come here to talk to you okay?","okay, but ross, eventually you and i are gonna be dating.",what?,"okay-okay! two very good points, look i’ve known you both a long time, and i’ve never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as you’ve been since you’ve got together. do you really want to throw that all away over a room? that is so silly. now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?"
"yes oh— —do i want sugar in my coffee? no, just some milk would be good carol. thanks. okay, do you remember all that stuff i taught you yesterday?","yeah! i’m gonna have a boyfriend, you’re gonna have a girlfriend…",what? is it the comet?,"okay! all right! now, chandler you-you wanna live with monica, right?"
don’t do that.,"but y’know what, if you think it’s gonna be okay we’ll just work out a system. y’know, it’ll be like college, i’ll hang a hanger on the door and put a sign, ""come back later, i’m gettin’ lucky.""","joey come—i can’t believe—i bring you here to see the bapstein-king comet, one of nature’s most spectacular phenomenon, and all you care about are bugs stuck in tar and-and some woman!","and mon, you wanna live with chandler, don’t ya?"
"seriously, your dad doesn’t like pranks.","umm, well let’s see monica and chandler are occupied.",show me where?,good! a verbal contract is binding in the state of new york!

oh crap!,"all right, well the place was closed. i’ll just copy it later.",rachel!! monica!!,"wh-why?! why-why-why would it, why would it be weird?"
so now what have we agreed?,"well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. wait a minute, unless you’re thinking about naked wednesday’s.",i can’t believe this!!,no!
and-and what else?,i cannot believe that you didn’t tell me that we are still married!!,"yeah, i guess we don’t have a choice. help us! please help us! we’re stuck up on the roof and we can’t get down!!!","no! no! it would be weird if we were still in that place, i mean are you still in that place?"
very good.,when?! after the birth of our first secret child?! ross didn’t get the annulment; we are still married.,"i know, i wasn’t finished. but don’t worry! we’re gonna go down the fire escape!!",good! me neither! so it’s not a problem. we’re just two friends who happen to be roommates.
i’m just visiting my good friend carol.,"so, i still have boxes here. i still have boxes at ross’s, and i have nowhere to live! wow. i could so easily freak out right now.","ugh. well, we’re just gonna have to jump. yeah. now, we’re gonna have to make sure to land to the right of that patch of ice, okay? not hit the dumpster on the other side and uh, and try to avoid that-that weird brownish red stuff in the middle. so, when you get down there… you go up to the roof and you let me in.",really?! we are?
yeah!,"well, maybe-maybe i could be your roommate pheebs.","yeah! oh yeah, you’ll be fine! it-it’ll be uh, just like bungy jumping. y’know? but instead of bouncing back up you-you won’t.",ohh! that would be great.
carol…lesbian?,well there’s an idea!!,"well, i’m gonna lie to you joey, it’s a possibility.","yeah, i didn’t think of that."
what line?,"that would be great! wait, how long is denise gone for?","oh, all right. tails! can you-can you see what it is?",so are you sure about this whole moving in thing?! i mean it’s a really big step! and-and what’s the rush?!
"all right, i’m sorry. i’m sorry i didn’t tell you but you were so mad already!","december 26 th , huh maybe she’s santa clause.","okay. well, you be careful.","no, i-i-i’m serious, okay? i mean, think about it. you move in, you start fighting over stupid game rooms, next thing y’know you break up!"
"okay, maybe they are not funny to you…","oh look who it is, my husband. the apple of my eye.",well i’m jumping! i have a son! okay? he won’t have a father if-if i die!,"okay, there are no stupid fights!! this isn’t about the room, this is about what the room…represents! and unfortunately, this room could destroy you!!"
or carol! but they’re funny to kids and who is it hurting?!,"well sure, if you say you’re gonna take care of everything i have no reason to doubt you. give me those forms! all right, now i’m gonna do this my way and i don’t want to hear a peep out of you!","y’know, y’know i’m lookin’ and i don’t think anyone’s home here. i say we just break the window, crawl through, and-and y’know explain later.","fine! it’s your life! i just don’t want to see you guys break up! which you will do if you move in together, but that’s what you want, there’s nothing i can do. don’t do it !!!!!"
"that was you ?! we heard about you in junior high! did you really just shake your fist in the air and shout, ""i will be revenged?!""",op! you’re peeping!,i don’t think so. hello? when you get in there…,"so umm, where are the other guys?"
"fine. fine, but i’ll have you know that once i taught him that stuff he called me fun aunt rachel. and i loved being fun aunt rachel but i’ll go back to being boring and uncomfortable aunt rachel if that’s what you want!","ross! y’know what, i just got—why? why did you do this?!","okay, do-do you have a good grip?",fighting?!
"look he doesn’t have any brothers or sisters, somebody’s gonna have to teach him this stuff! and i haven’t taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old doesn’t know anyway!","i don’t wanna hear ""three failed marriages!""","okay, i’m going to start climb down you now.","yeah. there’s no breaking them up, is there?"

tell monica i’m sorry.,oh yes.,"she’s your cousin. she’s your cousin! if she knew what was going on in your head she’d think you were sick ! or would she? let’s back up a second. she was the one who suggested opening a bottle of wine. she was the one who turned down the lights. she was the one that wanted to rent logan’s run , the sexiest movie ever. oh, i know that look. forget it. i want it. she wants it. i’m going in.",hey!
"yeah but, maybe it’s not what we think. maybe it’s tell monica i’m sorry i…drank the last of the milk.","…see i can’t decide whether it would go better next to the new wicker dining chair, the sahara desk, or the parker console table.","say something clever! okay, doesn’t have to be clever, it just has to be words. say some words. any words will do. oh my god! this is the longest that anyone has not talked ever! there is nothing you can say to make this worse!! so just say something!! i-i, i uh haven’t had sex in a very long time. yeah, you really shouldn’t have said anything.",y’know what would cheer you up?
"okay. phoebe, i-i think ross is right. what are we gonna do?","i know, i know. i went a little crazy.","oh, where are you guys going?","i’m giving this lecture on erosion theories tomorrow night, i think you should come."
okay.,hey.,ah. joey you’re-you’re having lunch with my mom?,"hey, you’re not going to believe this. i made up a joke and sent it in to playboy . they printed it!"
ross said there’s still no word from chandler.,"oh it does, it does! it is a room separating apparatus from colonial times.","y’know what? actually i’m kinda glad they’re leaving ‘cause uh, i need to talk to you about something.","yeah, they print jokes, interviews, hard-hitting journalism. it’s not just about the pictures."
oh but he did say that they found the grandmother wandering down fifth avenue.,"well there’s yore. and uh, y’know, yesteryear.","well this uh, this may be a little awkward.","here, check it out. it’s the first one, too."
"god! don’t—we can’t let her start getting ready! this is too awful! oh god, but wait she’ll be in the gown and then he won’t show up and then she’s gonna have to take off the gown…",oh honey he doesn’t need my help.,"no, its…its not that. umm, now what i’m going to say to you, i’m not saying as your friend. okay? i’m-i’m saying as it as monica’s older brother.",what?

oh!,"pheebs, i don’t know what to say. i guess the flea market was just better last time.","okay! you guys are getting married tomorrow and-and i couldn’t be more thrilled for both of you, but as monica’s older brother i-i have to tell you this. if you ever hurt my little sister, if you ever cause her any unhappiness of any kind, i will hunt you down, and kick your ass! what? i’m-i’m-i’m serious! come—hey! dude! stop it! okay? i’m-i’m not kidding here!",what?
okay.,yeah.,no problem.,"look, chandler, it’s my joke. but, hey, if it makes you feel any better they don’t print the name, so it doesn’t really matter who gets credit, right?"
oh thank you! oh god! can i have another one?,"yeah, y’know what? don’t look at it. seriously, don’t look at it.",yeah.,"no, it’s my joke, it’s mine. you can call them, they’ll tell you."
oh god i just can not imagine what is gonna happen if chandler doesn’t show up!,"ugh, those bastards! let’s go.","wow monica! hey, just so you know i had my uh, older brother chat with chandler.",it’s my joke.

"all right, we’ve got to tell her he’s gone.","you see, now, i would date this girl. she’s cute, she’s outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire. i mean, that’s got to come in handy",chandler? chandler?,"seriously, i-i asked you before and you still haven’t gotten it."
"ross, she’s gonna start getting ready soon!",i don’t know.,hey!,"joey, seriously, can i get my coffee?"
"all right, well how much time do you need?",hey.,"is uh, is monica here?",it’s my joke.

umm… i’m never gonna getting married!,"all right, wherever you wanna go is cool.",oh damn!,we’ll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truth—me.
"no monica! i’m serious! oh, maybe i should just forget about it. become a lesbian or something.",no.,"yes. yes. don’t worry. everything’s fine. we’ll uh, we’ll see you tomorrow at the wedding.","see, i would never snap at you like that."

hi!,right?,"yeah. uh, uh we promised we weren’t gonna tell anybody this but uh, about a month ago rachel and i slept together.",maybe i should open a divorced men’s club.

"what, because that’s your answer to everything?","okay joey, we’re luffing a little bit, so could you tighten up the cunningham?","yeah, i guess i should. man, y’know what i have to realize? maybe i’m just not the type of guy women can have just one night with. y’know, they-they always seem to want a little bit more. i should remember that.","look, i don’t think so pheebs. all right, i’ll do it. but just because you’re a friend."
"yeah, maybe if you’re in love. but ross, we are not in love, are we?","joey, come on! we just went over this!",hi.,all right! i want my key back!
excuse me?,"no! all right?! i did not see the bird! i did not see the fish! i did not see the piece of styrofoam that was shaped like mike tyson! i did not , because i was trying to teach you how to sail a boat! which obviously is an impossible thing to do!","i think we do. why don’t we go inside? look uh, i know why you’re here.",it’s right there!
what?!,what do you mean you quit?! you can’t quit!,"yeah, and to save you from any embarrassment umm, i think maybe i should talk first.","look, i’m sorry but you-you-you better go pheebs."

"oh please, you inhale your food!","no! no! no! i’m not yelling at you, i’m just yelling near you. oh god joey, ohh i’m my father. oh my god, this is horrible! i’ve been trying so hard not to be my mother i did not see this comin’. oh, joey, i’m sorry. i’m so sorry. i just wanted you to learn.","okay. okay. y’know what? if you want to, we can do it one more time. i mean i’d-i’d be okay with that. in fact, i have some time right now.",yep. okay.

"okay. so these signals ross, explain this to me, ‘cause maybe i need to be more careful. i mean, am i sending you these signals right now?","i’ve never interviewed anyone before. i’ve actually never had anyone work for me before. although when i was a kid, we did have a maid, but this is-this isn’t the same thing.",what? oh yeah. i’m sorry. i mean i-i think i went a little crazy. i mean i was thinking about myself when i really—i should have been thinking about you rach…,"what, are we keeping thanksgiving a secret this year?"

thank you. what? you don’t want to see this do you?,"that’s your whole name, okay of course it is! okay, well let’s-let’s just have a look-see here.","i’m just saying if you can’t eat by yourself, how do you expect to have a baby by yourself?",what? that's impossible.

wow…,"oh, god, i know it, that i freaked you out.",trying to date this woman.,"no, it’s not what i want either. i mean i-i can’t force myself to fall in love with her again now."

yeah well it looks great!,so did you read your evaluation yet?,"will, high school was-was a long time ago.","you wanna, you wanna grab some coffee?"

how are you?,i’m thinkin’ no.,"no need to point, she knows who ross is. ",right. good night.
yeah it is.,"umm, i said i thought you were a good kisser, and uh, and that i like your tiney-tiny touchie.",no. no.,yeah?
that’s so sweet.,"well, it gets worse. when asked if you take initiative i wrote, ""yes, he was able to unhook my bra with minimal supervision,"" and under problems with performance i wrote, ""dear god, i hope not,"" and then uh, then i drew a little smiley face, and then a small pornographic sketch.","uh actually, there-there was also that exchange student from thailand but i-i don’t think he-he knew what it was.",oh hi!
oh.,"maybe it’s not as bad as i think. y’know, maybe they didn’t take it the way i meant it.",that was in high school! it’s not like it was binding forever.,wow! uh…how are you?
"oh no, i really don’t want any— —oh! thank you. oh. oh ross…","ugh, i just gotta get the thing back!","look rach i-i’m sorry, okay? i…i was a stupid kid, okay? the only reason i joined…","oh that’s right. well uh, would you be interested in seeing a ukrainian film?"
here comes another contraction.,yeah?,…co-founded. co-founded the club was because i was insanely in love with you. obviously i didn’t handle it very well. but if you think about it the i hate rachel club was really the i love rachel club.,great! well umm…
"oh, that’s very—really very-very okay.",oh my god! joey!,no-no! no-no. no-no.,"sure! uh, let me get it for ya."
"no, i don’t think we’ll be doing that.",ugh!,it was no big deal. we-we…said that the rumor was…that umm…you had both…male and female reproductive parts.,i think it’s coming from your bag.
oh. oh wait no.,"okay, i think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but we’re gonna have to get into mr. zelner’s office. now, he doesn’t get in until 10, so he’s no problem, but his assistant, betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk.","actually, billy tratt is gay now. so-so that one’s not really our fault.",so apparently i’m available for lunch.
no-no-don’t! don’t leave me here with these people.,"yeah, well betty’s kinda sad. which is why i believe i can lure her away with these chocolates. now, while i distract her, you get in the office.","rach, i think you’re reading a little too much into it.",you’re moving?
no ross! ross! ross! my child has no father!,let’s roll!,"look, what do you want me to do? do you want me to call everyone in the entire school and tell them it wasn’t true?!",so does-does joey know you’re moving?

""umm, i’m a recovering alcoholic. i’m a mormon,"" or ""i got so hammered last night i’m still a little drunk?""",uh rach…,"married couples send out cards, families send out cards, people who have been dating for a couple of months do not send out cards! what-what is she crazy?!"

"well… that’s…y’know—that’s—we’ve been alone for the last twenty minutes we’re doing okay. besides y’know what? i-i—maybe we won’t be alone, ‘cause lately i-i—things have been happening between me and ross, y’know? right before i went into labor, we-we had this kiss. y’know? so it might be the…the beginning of something.",hey guys do you think this is too slutty—hi kash!,no-no. we…,"sending out a holiday card, together, i mean i just don’t know if we’re really quite there yet."
"uh-huh. y’know what i was, i was thinking about?","yeah! all right, i’ll see you guys later.","um uh…we’re-we’re just having this baby together but uh, uh that’s all.",yeah.

nothing.,"well better than you, but y’know still not what you want.",y’know what i think it is? i think you’ve made such a nice home for her over the last nine months that she just doesn’t want to leave.,"really?! i mean, even with the card?"

"oh please, he’ll be with his real family, the twins and little miss new boobs.",yes.,what is that?,"yeah, we’re not just doing a card! y’know, she-she also wants to have the conversation about where the relationship is going."
"i’m just saying that y’know, someday ross is gonna meet somebody and…he’s gonna have his own life. right?",okay.,"oh thank god, i thought she had two heads.","i know! i know! why do you guys need to have this conversation?! huh? i mean no self-respecting man would ask a woman, ""so, where is this going?"""
i just never thought i would raise this baby all by myself. pretty dumb huh?,chandler m. bing?,go!,"hey! you were a closed book! okay? i’m not a mind reader! besides, i hate those conversations. i’m horrible at them. really! maybe-maybe i need kind of a gesture. y’know, something that says we’re moving forward without having to talk about it."
joey. honey what would i do without you?,oh my god.,yes you can!,smaller than that.
"oh, hon can you grab me my other box of tissues? they’re right on that chair under ross’s coat.",oh it’s all right. i’m guess i’m just done with the whole dating thing. it’s one more thing in my life that’s suddenly completely different. this is hard.,hey! hey! come on! you can! i know you can do this! let’s go!,"uh, bigger than that."
okay.,thanks sweetie.,no! come on let’s—one more time! one final push! ready? 1…2…3!,whoa-hello! we were closer with the mixed tape.

"oh yeah, she can't be herself.",good night.,oh! oh! she’s upside down but she’s coming! she’s coming!,"here we go. mona umm, i think it’s time we-we had a conversation about-about where things are with us."
"yeah, totally! you are in such good hands. and i'm so good with meeting parents. with the father, you know, you want to flirt a little bit, but not in a gross way. just kind of like ""oh mr. pincer, i can see where wallis gets his good looks...""",wow! what did he do?,oh! oh my god oh! oh my god she’s here.,"aw, we-we are so… so umm, well i-i-i like you and i-i love umm, y’know hanging out with you. and i mean-i’m having a lot of fun."
"uh, he took the sat's for me.",i can’t. i’m busy. i’m apartment hunting.,oh she’s…she’s perfect.,"i mean, there’s no point in spending time with someone if-if it’s just fun. it’s gotta be, it’s gotta be going somewhere right? so where-where is it going? ah! that’s-that’s the real question. and-and the answer is…is it’s going somewhere…fun. now i-i know what you’re thinking, fun was fine for you like ten years ago y’know, but you’re-you’re not getting any younger. no i mean—no not you, not you, you—you are getting younger. i mean—you-you look like you’re getting younger by the second—what’s your secret?"
"ssshyeah, well, duh! i mean...","yeah, i can’t live with joey once the baby comes. i don’t want my child’s first words to be, ""how you doin’?""",oh it’s okay. they’re just-they’re just wrapping her up.,"well, well to sum up, we’re having fun, you look young."
"oh, with the mother, just... just constantly tell her how amazing her son is. take it from me, moms love me. ross's mom one time actually said i'm like the daughter that she never had.","well, i haven’t discussed it with him yet, but i know he’s gonna be relieved. last week, he brought this girl over and i started talking to her about morning sickness and then i showed her pictures from my pregnancy book.","oh, come in.",but that’s not enough. so… so…here’s a key to my apartment.
hi.,not so much.,"the doctor says it’s completely normal with all the hormones. plus, you-you’re sleep deprived.",really.
"i just finished getting phoebe all dressed to meet mike's parents. she's so nervous, it's so sweet!",oh my god! was she old? does she have a view?,"uh actually, we-we’ve narrowed it down to two names.","not just a key, i gave her the only key! i am now a homeless person in a very serious relationship."

"okay... aahhh... please laugh for mommy... please? please laugh for mommy... not funny huh? oh so, is it... only offensive novelty rap? or maybe just, you know, rap in general? 'cause mommy can rap... my name is mommy and i'm here to say / that all the babies are ... oh, i can't rap... allright sweetheart... this is only because i love you so much, and i know that you're not gonna tell anybody... i like... big butts and i cannot lie... / you other brothers can't deny... / when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist and a round thing in your face... yes! yes! yes! yes! oohhhhh! oh! i like big butts and i cannot lie... / you other brothers can't deny... oh emma you're laughing! oh you are, you really do like big butts, don't you. oh you beautiful little weirdo...",ahh.,hey janice!,i love you!

shake it!,"honey, it’s not just a matter of where you put it. i mean a baby changes everything. they cry all the time. i mean imagine bringing home some girl and trying to score when there’s a screaming baby around.","oh my god! i’m sorry, i was talking to this nurse, completely forgot.","your page said come to the hospital, what? what was it? what happened?"
shake that nasty butt...,"honey, it’s so sweet that you want me to stay, but i-i can’t do that to you. i mean it would disrupt your entire life.","yeah. she’s putting her down now, that’s her.","oh. oh. thank god, most women don’t even feel them."

timmy was my boyfriend and you made out with him!,and there’s marketing…,yeah and we'd want to make sure emma has someone like monica who is more uh. uh discliplinarin.. someone who can be firm and strict.,ya wanna hang back and take our own cab?

"mon, i'm so sorry.",you’re supposed to realize that they are adults! and that they can make their own decisions.,"hey, hey, hey... if you two are happy, then i'm happy for you. i'm fine!","that depends, how much did you hear?"
are you okay mon?,heyyyyy! contraceptives are not always effective! right?,"absolutely. i'm fine! totally fine. i don't know why it's coming out all loud and squeaky, 'cause really, i'm fine. i'm not saying i wasn't a little surprised to see you guys kissing. i mean, at first i was like.. but now that i've had time to absorb it; lovin' this.",what was wrong with mona? 
"look amy, it got a little of control..um.. and i'm sorry. you're my sister and uh.. if it really means that much to you..","oh, come on kids! a little help here!","it's all working out! me & charlie, and you two. you know what we should do?",yeah baby!
uh. no.. i was going to let you use my ralph lauren discount.,"joey, just because they’re not getting married doesn’t mean this is going to be a disaster. maybe they have a plan!","no. we should all have dinner. yes, we'll do it tomorrow night. i'll cook!!","no, no, it was just our parents and 1 or 2 friends. it was a small wedding."
she needs changing.,"hey, now wait a minute! i get when you told people at first that you wanted to be an actor they laughed at you! now come on bobby, why don’t you tell us a little bit about your band?","weird? what? what's weird? the only thing weird would be if someone didn't like mexican food, because i'm making fajitas!!",would you excuse us for a second? umm…. what are you doing?
we weren't doing anything!,really?,"i thought i heard voices! hi charlie! hi joey. and.. oh! you're gonna have to introduce me to your new girlfriend. i'm just kidding, i know rachel, i know. come, please come in. come in.","okay, okay. ooooh, ooh maybe i rode in on a harley"
shhh.,oh excuse me! am i ruining my life?,oh! that is so thoughtful. she's a keeper. and what did you bring me?,"well, um, actually, i-i took her to the planetarium. that’s-that’s where we had our first date. um, she walked in and i had the room filled with lilies, her favorite flower…"
"no, come on, that is a lie. we also kissed in barbados.",so forcing her to marry bobby is gonna make that happen?,"underwear, a toothbrush, and van halen cd. i can use all these things!!","then, fred astaire singing the way you look tonight came on the sound system, and the lights came down. and i got down on one knee and written across the dome in the stars were the words ""will you marry me?"""
"yeah, you started it! i've got to chill.","okay bobby, why don’t we just come over here and let them have a little moment.",what? fine? because i am! aren't you? aren't you? aren't you? you see? who else is fine?,"oh, no, mom, it’s just monica this year."
"we feel so terrible about this, ross.",no! seriously! what’s wrong with you?!,you know what? that is a very good idea. i'm gonna go make a pitcher of margaritas.,"no, of course, um… um, everybody? um, i-i just wanted to say…on behalf of my new bride, rachel , and myself. umm, that if…if in 35 years, we’re half as happy as you guys are, we’ll count ourselves the luckiest people in the world."
ross? can we just close the door?,phoebe?,"the first batch of margaritas was not so great, but the second batch is gooooood.","…and then, we could’ve gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar!"
"ross, say something. anything.","look at that guy by the window, wow!","oh, guys, this is fun, isn't it? you know? just the four of us. just hangin'.",but having a dove place the ring on your finger would’ve been no problem?
hel yeah.,"oh, what is wrong with me lately? i mean it’s like every guy i see—i mean look here. look at that guy for example, i mean normally that’s not someone i would-would be attracted to, but right now, with the way i’m feeling, all i want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.","i'm fine! hey, i'm great! i'm just.. i'm just proud of us. there's no weirdness, no tension.","yeah! and! and, it was the easiest 400 bucks i’ve ever made."
"no, no, no!",yeah.,"we make a great foursome. we should do more stuff together. ooh! let's take a trip. okay, where do you think we - we can go?",yeah.
"ross, this is not how we wanted you to find out about this. you have every right to go nuts.",really?! so this has happened to you?,my fajitas!!,"i know, i know it was stupid."
"no, but you know what i mean.","wow! this explains so much! last weekend, i went from store to store sitting on santa’s lap.","fajitas! be careful, very hot plate, very hot plate!!","no, actually i thought about it when, when we were going out. it’s how i imagined i uh, i would ask you to marry me."
calm ourselves?,ah.,that is gonna hurt tomorrow!,"it’s a good thing i didn’t do it, because it sounds like it would’ve been a very expensive wedding. okay, good night"
"well, what would we be doing?","well, y’know what? i go see my doctor tomorrow, i’ll ask her about this. maybe she can give me a pill or something.",everyone? i would like to make a toast to rachel and joey.,even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldn’t get messed up?
feel me up?,hi!,"and to love. ah, love. l-o-v-e, love. l is for life. and what is life without love?",that’s all i’m askin’
hey.,"oh, okay. hey, can i ask you a question? was it me, or-or was the guy who took my blood sample really cute? y’know who i’m talking about, bald haircut, hairy fingers…","o is for ""oh, wow!"" the v is for this very surprising turn of events, which i'm still fine with by the way. e is for how extremely normal i find it. that you two are together. and now one day you might get married and have children of your own.",y’know i don’t understand why they didn’t cry. it was a beautiful speech.
"oh, you bet.","yes, you are.",totally.,"hey! all that stuff you said about true love, you were right, i mean, we did learn a lot from mom and dad! and that picture of chi-chi with her mischievous grin. and what you said about nana. ohh, yeah she really would’ve wanted to be there. and you know what? i think she was."
"okay, well, we brought you some wine.","oh, really, really good. but enough about me, come on! where-where are you from? what do you do?","i'm sorry, it must be the pressure of entertaining. i think everyone would feel better if we had some flan.",hey!
"well, maybe the next batch, we could all get some.","right! right! i-i actually meant in your spare time, do you cook? do you ski? or do you just hang out with your wife or girlfriend?",no!,why’d you say no?
no awareness.,"oh, i love to ski! how amazing is this?!",wasn't it? and you thought it would be awkward with joey and that you never really liked rachel.,"just then or-or all the time, ‘cause we-we have jobs y’know."
"look, charlie, i just want you to know. ross is just having a little trouble adjusting to the thought of joey and me. you know, he normally doesn't drink like this.",no. i’m very comfortable.,okay.,shhh! we’re not talking.
"ross, you don't even have oven mitts on!","no! shoot, dr. schiff what kind of question is that?!","okay, i guess it's just flan for three! hey, hey, that rhymed!","uh, double latte, extra foam."
ooy.,well would you like me to lie down on the table?,"oh, oh. of course. god, i'm so stupid. you guys are a couple now. i mean, you probably just want to be alone.","come on, it's fun!"
"oh my god, are we supposed to answer?",do you feel it too?,"hey, hey, it's fine. it's totally fine. we've got plenty of margaritas. it's all good.",are you serious?!
"ross, you don't seem okay.",hi.,i don't even know what that's for.,wow! we are pretty good at this!
"oh, that's okay, girls tend not to like me.","well, let’s see. uh, they gave me cute doctor today and in the middle of the exam i put my pinky in his chin dimple.",thanks. did you stay here all night?,hey! we totally forgot about lunch!
"you know what, ross? i think we're gonna take off too.","okay, even this is turning me on!",so you took off my pants and shoes?,it tastes like feet!
"no, no, it's just that it's getting late...","oh hey! hey ross! hey how’s it, how’s it going with you and mona? are you guys still together?",what do you mean?,are you kidding?
"yeah, that's probably a good idea.",uh ross? you asked me that.,"hey, what are you talking about? i'm fine!",who just lost the respect of her unborn child.
"uh-huh. okay. you know what, joey, i don't think he's ever gonna be okay with this.","i think, if it was a little colder in here i could see your nipples through that sweater.","except we're not. i mean, we haven't been a couple in like, six years. oh my god, is that right? has it been that long?","yeah, so far nothing stupid."
thanks for dinner.,you gave her a key to your apartment?!,"this is crazy. i mean, six years? and because of me you guys aren't gonna be together? can i ask you something? really, what is this thing with you and rachel?","uh no, no just-just that he is a great guy."
so.,hey!,joey.,"yeah, you too."
"i say ‘cheesy line’, but ok.",yeah.,and she feels the same way?,"all right i've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because i wanna be a good friend, and damnit i am a good friend. so just, just shut up and close your eyes ."
"i am sorry, i don’t know, i am sorry, i don’t know why i did that!",what?,"well, then, maybe it's time we all moved on.","wait a minute! i saw that! on the discovery channel , yeah! about jellyfish and how if you... ewwww!! you peed on yourself?! phoebe and"

"ok, so sorry.","no! i do not care what my hormones are doing, i am not going to just do it with some random guy!","yeah, i'm sure.",okay. now-now-now should i climb down your front so we’re face to face or-or should i climb down your back so we’re-we’re butt to face.
"i am sorry! again... i don't know, i don’t know what happened, i must be nervous!","yes. hi, i’d like to order a pizza. okay, can i ask you a question? is-is the cute blond guy delivering tonight? very ambercrombie & fitch . i’ll call you back.",wow!,i would say that.

oh!,"yeah. so y’know, i have all of these feelings and i don’t know what to do about them, because i can’t date like a normal person, which is fine because i don’t need a relationship, i mean all i really want is one great night. just sex, y’know? no strings attached, no relationship, just with someone that i feel comfortable with and who knows what he’s doing. for just one great night, i mean is that really so…hard…to find. so how was your day?","so, do you get colours or just french tips?",amazing! amazing!

hi! happy thanksgiving!,i-i forgot my underwear.,so?,i’m-i’m sure that’s not true.

0,ross?,0,"oh, that's not cool."
0,you're pretty.,0,"no, chandler, you have to find the line between stealing and taking what the hotel owes you. for example hair drier, no, no, no, but shampoo and conditioners, yes, yes, yes. now, the salt shaker is off-limits, but the salt i wish i'd thought this through."
0,"alright. now that i'm back, why don't you just fill me in on what you've been up to?",0,"not my first time in a hotel, my friend."
0,"hey, they were popular when i left!",0,"no, no, no, you can't take the remote control!"

0,"fine, i will. alright, fill me in!",0,oh my god.
0,"yes. emma and i came in a little early to do research on the presentation. i actually made a few changes, but i think i'm caught up on everything. so ask me anything!",0,there's something new in the bowl.
0,"except that! oh, hello, mr. zelner. we're all ready for our presentation this afternoon.",0,"no, but i want...i want the pinecones!"
0,"what? i can't do that! i have the baby, and ross is not gonna pick her up for another hour.",0,it's not the same.
0,"well, there you go. you win, you win. you get to do the presentation, you'll knock 'em dead, no one will ever remember that i worked here, and then ralph will buy his helicopter, and super gavin will just fly right along side of him!",0,thank you for a delightful stay.
0,"no, i can't, i have a baby.",0,"oh, my maple candy!"
0,why would you do that?,0,"yeah, it does sound interesting, i mean, to listen to a woman complain for two hours, i don't think it gets bett..."
0,that's really nice.,0,what? how come that you don't have to go!
0,"then you're not gonna like what's coming. i'm sorry, i'm sorry, i'm sorry. thank you, thank you.",0,hey!

0,am i the only one who doesn't think that she's hot? ross?,0,"oh, no, it's no big deal, i mean, if i weren't doing this i'd just, you know, be at the gym working out."
0,thank you!,0,"oh, ha, i wrote that in one minute."
0,so hot i cried myself to sleep last night.,0,"we should probably get going, you know, we got a lot of ground to cover."
0,hello.,0,i don't think so.
0,"gavin, i just wanted to say thank you again for watching emma yesterday during the presentation. i really owe you an appology.",0,"oh, well he's obviously late and the rule in my class is ""if you can't come on time, then don't come at all"". an option that many of my students use. shall we?"
0,"well, when we first met, you know, i thought you were pompous and arrogant and obnoxious ...",0,"you know what, he's a big boy, i'm sure he'll find us, ok?"
0,"no, i just mean that, you know, first impressions don't mean anything. and i-i think you're a really good guy and i'm sorry that i misjudged you.",0,"oh, damn it!"
0,"hello. but you know what, hey, new day, new leaf, i am just really really happy ... i'm sorry, obviously heather's ass has something more important to say so i'll just wait 'till it's finished.",0,"so, where did you get your undergraduate degree?"
0,i was giving you an appology and you were totally checking her out!,0,"oh, it's not over!"
0,"oh wow, you are really, you're really a creep.",0,so basically all nuts?
0,"oh yeah, i'm jealous. ""oh gavin, please, please look at my ass"". stop looking at my ass! i mean, i just think you are totally inappropriate, ok? this is a work environment, she's your subordinate.",0,i've lost the will to live.
0,"that is totally different for two reasons. one - i didn't know that you knew that. and two, i wasn't some creep staring at his ass, we had a deap meaningful relationship.",0,what?
0,"it was ... oh my god. he didn't have a last name. it was just ""tag"". you know, like cher, or, you know, moses.",0,"oh... ok, fine. but... ehm... i just have one question for you, ehm... when we exit should we walk, or run, or prance, or stroll..."
0,"oh, you know what - my first impression of you was absolutely right. you are arrogant, you are pompous ... morgan! morgan! tag's last name was morgan! huh!",0,"oh, hey you guys! this is charlie! charlie, this is phoebe and my sister, monica."
0,"yeah well what are you, his boyfriend?",0,"yeah, charlie is gonna be joining my department."
0,"hey, listen, joey, about molly, i really prefer if you didn't go after her.",0,ranion's theory of species variegation?
0,"because it took us months to find a good nanny and i wouldn't want anything to, you know, drive her away.",0,"oh my god, she's great! i mean, we-we have so much in common and she's just cool, and funny..."
0,"rachel green's office!! give me that phone! hello, this is rachel green, how can i help you? uh huh ... ok then ... i'll pass you back to your son",0,really? wh-what's wrong?
0,"um, excuse me gavin, i have a question i need to ask you.",0,"i'm sorry, rachel, this is charlie wealer, she's a collegue."
0,if you like looking at butts so much why don't you just go look at a mirror?,0,wh-what's going on?
0,"oh, please, i don't care about you enough to bug me. in fact, from now on, i'm going take the high road. and i'm going be very very nice to you, you ""momma's boy"", starting right now.",0,"no, i arranged that..."
0,hi!,0,"so, eh... it's probably gonna be hard for you to leave boston, huh?"
0,"yeah i am, i am! oh, but first of all, monica, i would like to introduce you to my very talented colleage and more importantly my wonderful friend gavin mitchelle.",0,"ooh... so sad... still, it can't be easy for you to leave harvard? especially after working alongside a nobel prize winner like albert wintermeyer?"
0,"oh no no no no no, gavin can't, he already has plans, most likely with his mother.",0,you... you dated albert wintermeyer?
0,why did you invite him?? i can't stand that guy!,0,... and you called him alby!? i mean that's like... like calling albert einstein... er... alby...
0,i was faking it! can't you tell when i'm being fake?,0,"eh, you think? i mean, you went out with a guy who improved the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10!"
0,"hey, mr philips, nice suit!",0,"oh! like what?! oh i'm sorry, i don't mean to pry... it's just that this must be what regular people experience when they watch ""access hollywood""."
0,shh!,0,who is intimidating to a guy who won the nobel prize?
0,"i still can't believe you invited gavin. allright, he is the last person i want to see.",0,two? wha...? don't tell me you dated benjamin hobart
0,"god, i hope he doesn't show up. of course he's not gonna show up, the guy hates me.",0,oh my god! have you ever been in a relationship with someone who hasn't won the nobel prize?
0,what?,0,"oh yeah? no, no nobel prizes for him?"
0,"oh, monica, you think skippy liked you? honey, all those buys had a bet to see if he can knock you over.",0,huh... huh... what a loser! some more wine?
0,"oh, ok, thank you. do you see what all the guys see in her?",0,oh great! after i finish my wine i'm going to blow my... eh. average-sized brains out.
0,"yeah, sure!",0,"she... she only dates geniuses and nobel prize winners. oh my god, at the chinese restaurant earlier today, i put chopsticks in my mouth and pretented to be a woolly mammoth."
0,"oh, give me!",0,"of course you would, your brains are smaller than mine!! man, i can't compete with the guys she goes out with, they are so out of my league! oh my god!"
0,"ahhhh , you brought rats to my birthday party?",0,"oh much, much worse. i did my impression of joan rivers as one of the earliest amphibians... ""can we walk""? oh, you... you like that?"
0,are you comparing my daughter to a rat?,0,what?
0,"whhh wait, you're gonna leave my party to take care of a box of rats?",0,nice to meet you.
0,"hi. thanks for the party, honey. should i help you clean up?",0,"oh, i'm no actor, i'm a professor of palaeontology."
0,"yeah, i just get a little bummed when my birthday's over.",0,"oh, well no, but i mean, she only goes out with really, really smart guys."
0,mmm hmm.,0,i'd lead with that.
0,no.,0,just some boys gave me their phone numbers.
0,"well, it was, and you would have seen it if you didn't showed up at ... 9 30?? god! oh, this party was lame ...",0,"it's actually a 1,000,000$ prize."
0,"oh, you bought me a present! why?",0,"yeah, maybe. i do have my whole career in front of me. i mean, i can still win a nobel prize. although the last two papers i've written were widely discredited."
0,"aww. well, ok, well that's very nice. and you wrote a card . ""from gavin""",0,and sexy.
0,"awww, awww, it's beautiful.",0,"yeah, you're right, thanks pheebs, i'm gonna go find her."
0,"see, gavin, you're capable of being a nice guy. why did you give me such a hard time?",0,stop going through my stuff !
0,well monica seems to think it's because you have feelings for me.,0,"hey rach, have you seen charlie anywhere?"
0,you do?,0,i'm smarter than him !
0,"see? why, gavin, why? right when i'm about to change my opinion of you, you go and you ... and you do that ...",0,"hey, i thought i'd end up kissing charlie too ok? but surprise !"
0,hi guys! listen i really need your help. i think i did something really stupid.,0,"yes, she is this new professor of my department that i did not kiss."
0,no not that. i kissed gavin last night.,0,why do you care so much?
0,"yeah. it was after the party, we were on the balcony and...",0,"oh, i don't know, they seem to have a shared interest in each other's tonsils..."
0,"you know we were all alone and he was being really nice to me and, oh and he gave me this scarf...",0,"yeah, it's no big deal. i mean, i just met her and i'm fine with it..."
0,"you know honey, there is a thin line between love and hate, and it turns out that line...is a scarf!",0,"oh, god. i forgot how hot she was!"
0,"i don't know. it's so complicated. i work with this guy, you know, i have the baby, and i have ross, and i just...i don't know what to do and i have to be at the office and see gavin in ten minutes.",0,i'm gonna get some more coffee.
0,or...i could call in sick and not deal with it at all...,0,ok.
0,who is it?,0,"uhm no! think less of you! no, i don't think less of you. i mean, you saw someone you liked and you kissed them. i mean, those people who like someone and don't kiss them... those-those people are stupid, i hate those people."

0,oh! molly! you're not ross.,0,"oh, no! the met! the metropolitan museum of art."
0,"right, right, yes!",0,"yeah, most of it it's a place packed with confused angry baseball fans!"
0,what?,0,"yeah, uh, uh, ok, there's this great rare bookstore on madison avenue. you know what? she loves architecture, you know what you should do? you should take a walk down fifth to the saint patrick's cathedral and there there's this great little pastry shop that she'd love."
0,no! that's ok! that's ok! that's ok! no no no no! this is my business associate gavin. he's just being silly. gavin come out from behind that curtain!,0,but i'm not! . you know what if you're in the mood for thai food...

0,there isn't. there is totally isn't.,0,"now, do you have any idea what you just said?"
0,"all right. look. gavin...i...i guess i felt guilty that you were here, which i shouldn't. you know ross and i are not in any relationship but...he is the father of my child, and you know we do live together and plus there is just so much history...you know it's just...i don't know, i'm sorry, i'm just all over the place.",0,"ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, monet is not spelt m-o-n-a-y. i just... i wrote that out phonetically for you."
0,yes,0,"yeah, yeah that means... you know? we just... we don't have time for this."
0,people keep saying that. oh i'm sorry gavin,0,"ok, but you know what? i gotta say, i'm really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly!"
0,so seriously...rodeo clown?,0,wow. what does that mean?
0,"oh, hey! hi, there you are, i’ve been looking for you everywhere!",0,ok! so let's move on to the renaissance?
0,"listen, my mum is not bringing the baby back until nine o’ clock. so i was hoping you and i could have a chance to kind of talk… somebody here?",0,"nah ah! nah ah! no no no! no ad-libbing and dude, you can't touch the paintings."
0,who?,0,no!
0,you’ve being seeing someone?,0,"haha! got ya! die, die, die !"
0,"hi, and i am also emma’s mother.",0,"respectfully, professor r. geller. , closes the laptop and joins charlie on the sofa] hey!"
0,wow. she does that a lot!,0,"hey, how was the met?"
0,"what, what, wait a minute! you haven’t even told her you were a doctor, yet? how long have you known her, like an hour?",0,"yeah? joey really knows his art, huh?"
0,"ok, ross, what’s going on here, are we just bringing strange women back to the apartment now?",0,what do you mean?
0,how do you know about that?,0,"wait a minute... when you guys walked into the met, did you go to the right?"
0,"oh, that’s what this is all about? did you bring her up here to get back at me?",0,"oh joey, joey! but still, i mean, it seems like you guys are having a great time together."
0,score.,0,what?
0,"oh god, i can’t believe you’re making such a big deal about this. it was one kiss, one guy, one time!",0,"what, i mean, a little, but no, what, go on."
0,yeah.,0,"yeah. but you know what? i think you should give joey a chance. i mean, he's a great guy, and sure he doesn't know that much about art but you know, you can always talk about that with someone else."
0,oh yeah.,0,"and if you think about it, i mean the reason he memorized all that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. you know, that's the kind of guy joey is."
0,what? who?,0,that was going to be my next argument.
0,"whoa, how do you know about that?",0,hey!
0,why didn’t i get that message?,0,glad i could help man.
0,"from the guy in the bar, why didn’t i get that message?",0,"hey, you guys!"
0,ross?,0,guess who's up for keynote speaker at the national paleontology conference?
0,why?,0,"yeah, right! what was last time he met a submission deadline for an abstract well, why are you laughing?"
0,oh god. you know what? who you think you are? who are you to decide what messages i should or should not get?,0,"professor sherman, yeah. i've a meeting with him today."
0,yes.,0,"yeah, well... i think i know how to dazzle him."
0,"oh my god, i cannot believe this. you know i actually came in here hoping to have a mature conversation with you about us! but i can’t do that with someone who hides my messages and brings crazy women back to my apartment!",0,tsz... no! .
0,"oh, ross, this is just so messed up! what’s wrong with us? you know when people hear about our situation they always ask, “what, you live together but you’re not a couple? and you have a baby, isn’t that weird?» and i say “no. you know what, it’s not, because it works for us!» but you know this doesn’t work. in fact this is the opposite of working!",0,"wait a minute, you guys. oh, i wanna ask you something. i-i i may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if i do, i'd love for you guys to come and hear me."
0,"and you know, we said that we would, we would live together as long as this makes sense. an maybe this, you know, just doesn’t make sense anymore.",0,it's in barbados.
0,hi. can emma and i live here for a while?,0,so-so what did the doctor say?
0,thank you.,0,how do you feel about all this?
0,hey! you remembered to put clothes on this morning.,0,what?
0,"oh, joey, it's so great to be back here. i gotta tell you, you're making it so easy on me and emma.",0,what? no! i am not going to give them ben!
0,"well, i'll probably be back to pick her up around six, but she's in the bedroom all ready to go. but she did actually fall back to sleep, so...",0,the data we are receiving from mri scans and dna testing of these fossils are - are staggering.
0,bye!,0,"i mean, we've been accepting leakey's dates as a given, but if they're off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can - you can just throw most of our assumptions, you know, right in the trash. so-so what i am saying is - is is that is that the repercussions could be huge! i mean, not just in palaeontology, but if-if you think about it, in evolutionary biology, uh, genetics, geology, uh, i mean, truly the mind boggles!"
0,hey!,0,"oh, that's not what you want..."
0,"you guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you?",0,"joey! hey, i need to talk to charlie. is she there?"
0,i was just asking 'cause i need someone to watch emma tonight.,0,i'm meeting with professor sherman about my being the keynote speaker...
0,"well, phoebe set me up on a date.",0,"it could be better! he, uhm... he fell asleep!"
0,why? what's the big deal?,0,barbados.
0,"what, slept together a year and a half ago? yeah, i'm all set.",0,what am i supposed to do? he's out cold! in fact he was just talking in his sleep before and evidently he wants someone named fran to spank him harder.
0,so i'll bring her by around seven? is that okay?,0,"i can't! if he realizes that i'm the one that put him to sleep, i won't get the job!"
0,"oh, you guys are gonna have so much fun! she's at such a cute age. oh, a couple things. now that she's eating solid food, she poops around the clock. and watch out for your hair, 'cause she likes to grab it. and oh, she's also in this phase where if you leave the room, she screams bloody murder, but ah... thanks, you guys. have fun!",0,oh my god! you really want me to be the keynote speaker? thank you!
0,"wow, everything looks so good! i think i'm gonna have the chicken.",0,hey...
0,"oh, well, that's - that's very sweet. thank you.",0,oh... ohh... i'd love to but i really have to grade these papers.
0,what?,0,"b, b, b, b, b!"
0,"so, what do think you wanna order? i'm really excited about that chicken.",0,"well, it had some good ideas, take off your shirt."
0,"well, come on, steve; let's not rule out nervous laughter. hey, now wait a minute. phoebe told me that - that you owned your own restaurant. that's impressive.",0,damnit!
0,really? what's that like?,0,hi amy!
0,"now, come on, come on, steve. there must be something that you like about yourself.",0,still sharp as a tack!
0,really?,0,ross? i... i grew up on your block! we had thanksgiving together last year... i had a baby with your sister!
0,"phoebe, it's me. i'm going to hunt you down and kill you!",0,"yes, yes, you did."
0,this is the worst date ever. how could you set me up with this creep?,0,hi rachel! here's your sister amy! she thinks i need pec implants!
0,i don't care! this guy is a nightmare!,0,ehm... her name is emma
0,he's not stoned.,0,what do i know? i just sell middle eastern food from a cart!
0,"yeah, four times.",0,oh my god!
0,"no, no, no, i admire a man who can cry.",0,what... what you working on?
0,don't touch my coat!,0,why don't you use your thesaurus?
0,"oh, sorry, it's my phone. hello?",0,"watch. here, you ehm... you highlight the word you want to change. go under tools and the thesaurus generates... 'gives'... 'gives' a whole list of choices. you can pick the word that sounds smartest."
0,"oh my god, this is the worst date ever!",0,seriously?
0,"look, you know what, i'm sorry, but did you really think that this was going well? what's up?",0,"well, do you wanna marry him?"
0,no.,0,absolutely! you'll love the feeling! there's nothing like it!
0,"what? what do you mean, ""there you are""? where was she?",0,"no, i can't. i have back-to-back classes. did molly say what she had? because my throat's been hurting?"
0,"well, uh...",0,i don't think that's what this is.
0,"really, really not.",0,"well, can i talk to you for a sec.?"
0,"all right, well that's good to know. good night, steve.",0,"um, i do not want her baby-sitting our child."
0,i just had a rough night.,0,"well, for one thing, she keeps calling her ella!"
0,eww!,0,"fine, we'll call the next one ella."
0,"oh, well, i...it's kind of weird talking to you about this, but...",0,"okay, um... i don't want her watching our baby."
0,yeah.,0,i... i don't know..
0,oh.,0,hey guys.
0,"oh, oh no. do you think she walked in, saw you and left?",0,"hey emma. oh, why is she wearing her hat so low? she can barely see. ."
0,"well, if it makes you feel any better, i wish my date hadn't shown up.",0,why not?
0,"well, he makes t-shirts for a living, and he thought it would be appropriate to give me this.",0,come here oh! there she is! hi!
0,"oh. huh. you know, it is weird that phoebe would set me up on a date that was awful on the same night that joey set you up on a date that didn't even show.",0,what?
0,hi you guys!,0,hi! what... . please tell me those are clip-ons.
0,"oh er... well you know emma started crawling? i realised that this place, is very unsafe for a baby. so i went to the store and got some stuff to baby-proof the apartment.",0,did she do this to her? i told you we shouldn't have left emma with her!
0,no. i was just going to do this myself.,0,that's not a thing !
0,"yeah, why? you don't think a woman can do this?",0,"amy, i ju... i just... i just wanna..."
0,monica...would you please tell joey that he is a pig?,0,no more falafel for you!
0,wha!? what!? come on! i found the hardware store all by myself!,0,"pheebs, what's wrong?"

0,hi!,0,"guess who's a finalist for a huge research grant! i'll give you a hint, he's looking right at you."
0,"yeah, i don't know who i was kidding. i can barely use chopsticks.",0,"oh, i'm so excited, i mean, apparently i beat out hundreds of other applicants, included five guys i went to graduate school with. not that i'm keeping score or anything... five !"
0,oh thank you so much. oh oh wait! you forgot your erm...your game.,0,"well, ok, it's for 25 thousand dollars. and if i get it, i'll finally be able to complete my field research! and there will be an article about me in the ""paleontology review""! yeah! that'll be the first time my name is in there, without people raising serious questions about my work!"
0,don't look at me i never get his jokes.,0,yeah. why?
0,just when you thought that dude couldn't get any wierder.,0,your ex-boyfriend?
0,"i don't know! i mean, what brought that on?",0,"so, your ex-boyfriend is gonna determine if your new boyfriend gets this grant? wow, your new boyfriend is screwed!"
0,no you really think that's what it is?,0,"well, if you think it would help."
0,"yeah! if you don't i will! of course your body's gonna change. your breasts are gonna get bigger, your ass is gonna get bigger, you're gonna lose bladder control. god! it's just such a magical time!",0,"ok, now, is there anything i can do to... you know, butter him up? anything he really likes?"

0,"man, don't be surprised if her hands and her feet get bigger too!",0,i can't believe i'm about to meet benjamin hobart. i've always thought of him as one of the people i'd invite to my fantasy dinner party. do you think there's any chance he'll bring christie brinkley or c3po?
0,"oh my god chandler! if you can't handle this, what are you going to be like in the hospital? with the blood and the screaming and the little present that's shooting out of her!?",0,"well, i... i am having a good hair day."
0,joey! why did you tell chandler that monica was getting a boob job?,0,i'm ok.
0,"yeah, seriously coz this is really heavy. i mean not for me because i'm only pretending to hold this, but for these guys.",0,"it's an honor to meet you. i can't tell you how long i've been an admirer of your work, i mean, that nobel prize, whoooo! i mean, i have to tell you that, you're one of the reasons i got into the field."
0,i'm so sorry pheebs.,0,"no, but, it's, you know, it's just a funny image, you know, the two of you, in this restaurant, with... tzz-zzz, mmm."

0,"ehhh, aw! . well, that's new!",0,"really? is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review, who was the voice of ""underdog""?"
0,can i ask you a question?,0,"if you don't believe me, let's go talk to him, okay? i'm telling you, he didn't ask me one paleontological question."
