4,22,11,12,"yeah, the stripper stole it.","[laughs, softly]"
4,22,11,16,"dude, i screwed up, you don’t have to turn me in!",
4,22,11,18,"oh, yeah, well i already did that! they said they’re gonna look into it right after they solved all the murders.",
4,22,11,20,"i did that too! they wouldn’t give me her real name or her number. they said, ""if i bothered them again they’d call the police."" i said, ""if you talk to the police, you tell them i’m missing a ring!""",
4,22,11,22,"look ross, i am so-so sorry. i-i-i…",
4,22,11,24,"oh, that sounds like fun, but we’ve got a ring to find!!",
4,22,13,0,"all right, okay, this is great, uh, chandler, you get behind the desk. and-and when she comes in hopefully, she won’t recognise you because, well, why would she? uh, okay, and then you buzz ross and i. you be mr. gonzalez, and i’ll be uh, mr. wong.",[to ross]
4,22,13,8,"there was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!",
4,22,14,0,"i don’t get it! it was in my room all night! and if she didn’t take it, and i didn’t take it; and you didn’t take it, then who did? shh! we’re trying to think!","[chandler] [the duck quacks.] [ross and chandler realise it at the same moment and stare at joey, who doesn’t get it. after a short pause, with the duck still quacking, joey figures it out and starts pointing at the duck.]"
4,22,16,0,if anything should happen to him…,
4,22,16,2,so! things can go wrong! you don’t know! what if he doesn’t make it?!,
4,22,16,4,"yeah, but what if he doesn’t? he’s such a good duck.","[with that we go into a little flashback about the guys’ memories of the duck. the first one is joey playing with him in the bathtub and drying him off. then it’s chandler sitting on his couch after they moved into the girls apartment, and chandler reading to him in bed, and him watching baywatch when all they had was the canoe and the duck was in a bucket of water. then we see ross eating some cereal and the duck watching him. he takes a lamp and moves the duck off of the table. then it’s chandler shooing them out of the bathroom in the girls’ apartment, joey revealing their disco cubby hole in the entertainment-center, then chandler playing hide-and-go-seek with them, and it’s concluded with various scenes with the duck flapping it’s wings. and the guys staring into the distance in remembrance of the duck.]"
4,22,16,5,"i’m so worried about him, y’know?",
4,22,16,8,h-h-h-how’s the duck?,
4,22,16,10,"ohh, great! oh hey, listen ross, thanks for being so cool about this.",
4,22,16,12,"no, it’s not. i mean you-you made me your best man and i totally let you down!",
4,22,16,14,"yeah, it is! you wouldn’t have lost the ring, right? y’know what, ross you were right from the start, he should be your best man.",[chandler]
4,22,16,16,"now, don’t argue with me…",
4,22,16,19,really?,
4,22,16,22,i gotta go check something over here.,[starting to cry] [he walks away so that they can’t see him cry.]
4,23,1,11,"it’s all london, baby! here we go.",[he takes a picture of a less than enthused chandler and starts towards the girls’ apartment.]
4,23,1,13,"yeah, in my third drawer on my dresser. you don’t want to lose that.","[chandler glares at him. at first joey doesn’t know why, it takes him a little bit to figure it out.]"
4,23,1,14,ohh!!,[runs to his room.]
4,23,2,4,woo-hoo!!,
4,23,2,6,london baby!,
4,23,2,8,london baby!!,[louder]
4,23,2,38,"bye, pheebs!","[they all start out, rachel gives each one a kiss, and says ""bye."" in the hall, joey says…]"

4,23,3,2,"okay, here! i wanna be the on camera guy. all right, first stop, westminster abbey.","[gives him the camera.] [joey folds out his ""pop-up"" map of london. all of the major landmarks pop-up like in a pop-up book.]"
4,23,3,4,"it’s london, baby! all right, the hotel’s here. wait. no, we wanna go… no. i know. i’m gonna have to go into the map.",[points to the map.] [sets the map down.] [so joey literally steps into the map.]
4,23,3,6,i got it! here we go.,[picks up the map and starts walking.]
4,23,3,8,"shhh! man, you made me lose it!",[pause] [he goes into the map again.]
4,23,5,0,"all right! westminster abbey! hands down, best abbey i’ve ever seen. hey! okay. what do you think of the abbey, chandler?",[pushes chandler in front of the camera.]
4,23,5,2,really? to what?,
4,23,5,4,"man, you are westminster crabby.",[he starts chasing chandler towards the abbey.]
4,23,7,0,hey!,
4,23,7,2,check this out? huh? yeah. that’s the stuff. what do you think?,[joey has this big tall hat with a british flag on the front of it.]
4,23,7,4,"well, i like it. here you go.",[he pays for the hat.]
4,23,7,6,"oh, i embarrass you?",
4,23,7,12,oh yeah? if you’re gonna make me choose between you and the hat? i choose the hat.,[puts the hat on.]

4,23,10,8,sh-shh-shh!,[he motions for her to watch something he has taped.] [cut to the tape joey made in front of some famous place in london with a rather famous english-type person.]
4,23,10,9,"okay, so say hi to my friend and tell him that you like the hat.",[on tape]
4,23,10,11,"oh, chandler.",[on tape]
4,23,10,15,that’s fergie baby!!,
4,23,10,18,"well, i was trying to figure out how to get to buckingham palace, right? so, i’m in my map and-and… hey!",[ross enters]
4,23,10,25,wait up!,[they both run to the bathroom.]
4,23,10,42,"yeah. hey, i hope ross didn’t think that we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here!",[pause]
4,23,11,1,"hey, pheebs! it’s joey!",[on phone]
4,23,11,3,"that just cost me four bucks. but uh listen, i just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing?",
4,23,11,5,"kinda, but i’ve just been having way too much fun.",
4,23,11,7,"no, i don’t think so.",
4,23,11,9,who’s seven?,
4,23,11,11,"ahh, the babies miss me?",[there is a knock on rachel and phoebe’s door.]

4,23,11,15,two pizzas?!,
4,23,11,17,"wait, well, where did you get it from?!","[phoebe has already hung up, leaving joey in the dark. so joey decides to watch some tv and turns on a rerun of cheers , with the theme song playing. at first, he’s happy, but as the song progresses joey gets depressed and homesick.]"
4,23,16,1,what’s in it?,

5,9,6,5,"yeah, i like that. but no-no, how does that explain why rachel found my underwear at your place?",
5,9,6,7,"well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet!",

5,10,7,6,don’t stop! move the bowl further away! ross could make that shot!,"[chandler slides the bowl to the far end of the counter. he tries again, but he hits the spoon to hard and the ball goes flying away.]"
5,10,7,7,"well, you suck! but at least you suck at a man's game now.",
5,10,7,9,"chandler, i can't be playing games, ross is gonna be home soon. and i have to write five whole pages if i'm gonna stick to his schedule.",
5,10,7,11,"all right! but uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?",[jumping up]

6,3,4,2,"but you’re still moving in together, right? because my ad came out today.",[shows him the paper.]
6,3,4,4,"yeah? i just figured y’know, after living with you it’d be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, y’know? someone i can learn from, someone-someone who’s different than me. and what’s more different than me; a guy who’s not 19 than say a girl who is 19? enh? not just a hat rack my friend!",[points to his head.]
6,3,8,0,"everything on your application looks really good—ohh! just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?",[exiting from chandler’s room with the new roommate]

6,4,2,22,"uh ross! are there uh, are there naked chicks on that piece of paper?",[interrupting him]
6,4,2,24,"well, i’ve just never seen a guy stare so hard at a piece of paper that didn’t have naked chicks on it.",

6,4,6,7,"no way! ‘kay look, if i have to go to the doctor for anything it’s gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!",[rolls over and shows chandler.]
6,4,6,9,why did i have to start working out again? damn you 15s!,[looks at the weights he was using.]
6,4,9,1,"dude! hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. besides it’s getting darker and more painful, that means it’s healing.",
6,4,9,3,"thank you, but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and i don’t want that hanging over my head. okay? besides, as soon as my insurance kicks in i can get all the free operations i want! yeah, i’m thinking i’ll probably start with that laser eye surgery too.",[phoebe enters.]
6,4,9,6,hey!,
6,4,9,9,"look, i’m telling you if i put my hand on my stomach right here it doesn’t hurt that bad.","[he puts his hand down his pants, like al bundy on married…with children always used to do.]"

7,13,1,10,no. rosita does not move.,
7,13,1,12,as in rosita does not move.,
7,13,1,14,the big deal is that it is the exact equal distance from the bathroom to the kitchen and it’s at the perfect angle so you don’t get any glare coming of off stevie.,
7,13,1,16,is there a problem?,[glaring at her]
7,13,3,1,"i told you not to move it! rach, how would you feel if say, i wanted to move you mom, and you said don’t, and i did it anyway and her head fell off?",

7,13,10,13,"no it’s not weird, it’s a miracle!",
7,13,10,15,"oh there is! if you want something enough and your heart is pure, wondrous things can happen!",

7,17,11,33,no. it just seems like ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge.,[kristen is not enjoying this.]
7,17,11,35,have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey?!,

7,18,8,11,what the?! commercial break,"[joey pounds the table and starts yelling at rachel, and which is drowned out by applause. rachel is desperately trying to tell joey that he’s on tv right now. he finally notices and he does his gracious loser face.]"
7,18,9,1,"any one of the brilliant actresses nominated for this award tonight deserves to take it home. unfortunately only one can. the nominees for best supporting actress are from passions erin goff. from one life to live mary loren bishop , from all my children sarah mchann, and from days of our lives jessica ashley. and the winner is… …jessica ashley from days of our lives . uh, unfortunately jessica couldn’t be with us tonight so i’ll be accepting this award on her behalf. and i’m sure that jessica would like to thank my parents who always believed in me. she’d also like to thank my friends, chandler, monica, ross, phoebe, and rachel who’s sittin’ right there!","[angrily and monotone] [shakes his head in disgust.] [there is applause, which joey disgustedly waits to dye out.] [they start to applaud again, but joey interrupts in with the rest of the nominees] [opens the envelope] [applause] [realizes something] [points at rachel.] [the music starts and his microphone is turned off, this angers joey again and he disgustedly exits.]"
7,18,10,1,"rach we had to get out of there because, look what i won!",[he whips out the award for best supporting actress that he accepted for jessica.]
7,18,10,3,"no-no! no, i’m accepting it on her behalf.",[he puts it up above the tv to display it.]
7,18,10,5,"sure i do! it’s a verb! as in, ""i behalfin’ it!""",
7,18,10,7,but why?! i should’ve won one and i really want it and she didn’t even care enough to come to the thing! it could also be a grammy,
7,18,10,9,come on rach! no one saw me take it! there was a whole table full of ‘em.,
7,18,10,11,"no! i want an award i did win! but nobody’s giving me any of those! plus—hey rach, if-if i put it up there right? when people come over they’ll see it and they’ll think i won it.",[points to the tv]

7,19,1,1,"i’m sorry, do i know you?",
7,19,1,3,"nothing, i’m just practicing blowing you off because i’m gonna be a big movie star!",
7,19,1,5,"well, no not yet. but the audition went really good.",
7,19,1,7,"oh, it’s this big budget period movie about these three italian brothers who come to america around the turn of the century. it’s really classy! oh, and the director is supposed to be the next, next martin scorcese.",
7,19,1,9,"yeah, there’s this guy from chicago who’s supposed to be the next martin scorcese, all right? but then this guy’s right after him. hello!",[joey’s cell phone rings and he answers it.]

7,19,1,15,"are you kidding me? i never rent a movie without it! oh. uh, okay uh let me call you back.",[listens] [listens] [hangs up.]
7,19,1,17,they want me to be totally naked in the movie!,
7,19,1,19,i know! my grandmother’s gonna see this!,
7,19,3,1,"i don’t know! it’s not like it’s porn! this is a serious, legitimate movie. y’know? and the nudity is really important to the story.",
7,19,3,3,you’re right. maybe i shouldn’t even go on the call back.,
7,19,3,5,well that’s true. and i am only naked in one scene. plus it sounds really great. my character’s catholic and he falls in love with this jewish girl. who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm. so we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other. it’s really sweet and-and tender.,
7,19,7,0,"hey, i’m back!",
7,19,7,2,"uh so, will-will i be reading the same scene again?",
7,19,7,4,"oh great! y’know i would’ve been perfect for this part, but whatever! y’know, thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie! good day!",[starts to leave.]
7,19,7,6,and scene! huh? wasn’t that fun? we did a little improv there. yeah! okay! so you-you-you-you were saying?,
7,19,7,8,wow! sure! that’s great!,
7,19,7,10,"yeah! yeah sure, just long as it’s handled tastefully and that barn is not too cold.",
7,19,7,12,so…what?,
7,19,7,14,yes!,
7,19,7,16,no. what?,
7,19,7,18,barmifsaed?,[the casting director shakes her head.]
7,19,8,1,nope.,
7,19,8,3,yep.,
7,19,8,5,that’s right.,
7,19,8,7,"i don’t know! i really want this part! and they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes. like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell ‘em you can! and just figure out how to do it later.",
7,19,8,9,i kn-i know! i know! okay? and apparently tomorrow when i go in to meet the director i have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like.,
7,19,8,11,i just have to call my agent and tell her i can’t do the part.,[gets up for the phone.]
7,19,8,13,unless what?,
7,19,8,15,like what?,
7,19,13,1,wow! this looks great!,

7,19,13,11,"thanks, you are such a good friend. and this is so weird.",[he goes into his room to try them on and closes the door.]

7,19,13,22,the silly putty ! it’s not so silly anymore!,[they hug.]
7,19,16,0,"and what’s cool is, the character is from naples, right?",
7,19,16,2,my whole family’s from naples!,
7,19,16,5,"oh! hey right! not a problem. i totally understand. you need to y’know make sure i don’t have any horrible scars or tattoos. don’t you worry; i have nothing to hide. so there you go, that’s me. one hundred percent natural! i tell ya, that has never happened before.","[he starts taking off his clothes.] [he drops his pants and stands back up and looks down.] [we cut to a camera angle looking at the casting director and movie director through joey’s legs.] [suddenly, there’s a thud as something falls off.] [everyone is shocked.]"
7,20,1,1,probably monica and chandler.,[a woman walks up to gunther in the background.]
7,20,1,28,hey guys! look who’s back! it’s ray-ray!,

7,20,2,14,you got me. i don’t…,[looking around]
7,20,2,16,"well, i’m sorry. i thought parents were coming! y’know? your parents are comin’! chandler’s parents are comin’! ross’s parents are comin’!",
7,20,2,18,well-well—see? parents are comin’!,
7,20,2,24,maybe you’ll order a little sangria?,[leaning down to her]
7,20,4,0,we should really learn how to play the real way.,[moves another piece.]
7,20,4,2,nice move.,
7,20,4,5,hey!,
7,20,4,8,"no, i’m performing the ceremony. i’m not wearing a tux.",
7,20,4,10,"multi-colored robes! ooh, and maybe a hat.",

7,20,6,2,"yeah, they’re not coming.",
7,20,6,4,somehow they got the idea that you only invited them because of me. they…feel a little unwanted.,
7,20,6,6,"look mon, if you could just call my mom…",
7,20,6,8,"come on! look just-just tell—let her know that you really want them to be there. let’s not forget, this is a woman that has sent you many lasagnas over the years.",
7,20,6,10,is it her fault that some of them didn’t make it to you?,
7,20,6,12,"i don’t know. just uh, just tell ‘em it was a mix-up with the invitations, or—no-no-no! blame it on the post office. they hate the post office. and the irish! but i don’t think you can blame it on them so…",[he dials the phone and hands it to monica.]
7,20,8,13,hey.,[entering]
7,20,8,15,"listen, i know the invitation says 6 00, but does that mean that you want people to get there at six, or the show is gonna start right at six?",
7,20,8,17,"right. right. the wedding, gotcha. but i mean, it’s gonna start a little late right? i mean, weddings start late. right?",
7,20,8,19,"ah. yeah. well look, the thing is it’s the same day as my niece’s christening and i really want my parents to be there in time to see me. ‘cause my part’s just in the beginning i’m not even in the rest of the show—wedding!",

7,21,2,1,"all right, uh… oh hey, you’ve done this before ross, well what did you say when you made up your vows?",[to ross]
7,21,3,25,"oh, i got it! how about saying something like, ""monica…",
7,21,3,27,"""…when i look back over our time together…""",
7,21,3,29,"well, i can’t do everything! look back over your time together.",[this starts a series of flashbacks beginning with monica and chandler in the waiting room in the one with the birth.]
7,21,3,70,can we come it yet?! we’re dying out here!,[yelling through the door]
7,21,4,0,hey!,

7,21,4,20,okay.,[joey leaves and monica comes up for air.]
7,21,4,26,i know! i mean it’s not like we weren’t cool about it.,[this starts a series of flashbacks starting with monica and chandler forcing joey to keep his new found knowledge of their secret relationship in monica’s bedroom in the one with all the kips.]
7,21,4,27,you?! and-and you?!,[to chandler] [to monica]

7,21,4,36,"all right! man, this is unbelievable!",[cut to rachel listening to a phone conversation between chandler and monica in the one with all the resolutions.]
7,21,4,61,"yes, but y'know what? it doesn't matter who knows what. now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!",

10,9,10,7,"how about those fries though, huh?","[holds the plate between sarah’s fingers and his plate, thus blocking her from reaching his]"
10,9,10,9,"you are beautiful, you know that?",[spotting her movements takes her hand into his own]
10,9,10,11,oh okay..,"[grinning, trying to hold in his impatience with her] [she takes her hand back] [then she reaches over again and joey moves his plate a little to the left, and she misses, then she reaches out again, and he moves his plate to the right , so she misses again. she tries a third time and this time, joey pushes his plate so far to the left, it drops off the edge of the table]"
10,9,10,12,now look what you did!!,[visibly annoyed]
10,9,10,14,"i don't like it when people take food off of my plate, okay?",
10,9,10,16,"well, i didn't mean it!",

10,9,12,2,"well, stuffed clams.",[jokingly] [the waiter arrives with their deserts]

10,9,12,20,"why, just a tiny little...","[he takes a little piece of sarah's dessert. at first he doesn't think it's that special, but then...]"
10,9,12,21,oh-oh! time lapse,"[sarah enters the room again, and stops when she sees her dessert is missing. joey has emptied her plate, and has a chocolate covered mouth, just like a kid.]"

10,14,2,31,"hey, hey... i can convince people to do anything, you know. i bet i can even get mike to do that ""thing"". what is it?","[phoebe whispers something in joey's ear, but after hearing it he jumps up, shocked]"

10,14,6,14,"maybe. well, i just think you guys can do better than this house, you know? or any other house for that matter.","[glares at him for a moment, then admits grudgingly]"
10,14,6,16,"fine, ok, if you love this house so much, then you should just live here, okay? i just hope you get used to that weird humming sound. hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...",[he turns his back to them and starts humming]

10,15,4,21,"i’m saying that… . this isn't working for me anymore, ok? estelle, you’re fired. goodbye. .",[pause] [he hangs up the phone]
10,15,7,1,"yeah, i just… i just feel bad about firing estelle. this is got to be killing her.",
10,15,7,3,"i don’t know. she’s got to be taking it hard, i was like her only client. except for this guy who eats paper. and i’m guessing he eats more money than he makes. look, i know she’s not a great agent, but she did stick with me for ten years. i’m gonna call her and hire her again.",
10,15,7,5,why?,
10,15,7,7,you blow me away.,[impressed]
10,15,7,9,"i promise. and that means, never having to give a reason.",[phoebe stops herself from laughing and leaves]
10,15,10,1,oh my god. hello?,"[still in shock when his mobile rings, he picks it up]"
10,15,10,3,estelle?,
10,15,10,5,"ok-ay. i just, i can't believe you're calling me?",[still scared]

10,15,10,11,"thanks for everything estelle. bye. ""out of area"". boy, i'll say.",[hangs up and reads the phone display]
10,15,13,0,"thank you all for coming. we're here today to pay respects to a wonderful agent and a beautiful woman... ..inside. as estelle's only two clients we would like to say a few words. dude, where's my speech? that is entertaining. al zebooker everybody.",[joey looks at the photograph] [joey looks for his notes. the man next to him is chewing something.] [the man swallows something and looks at joey.] [he applauds and al shows that there's nothing left in his mouth.]

10,16,4,23,"you know, i had a chance to stop her too!",[to ross]
10,16,4,25,"who loses fifty seven coin tosses in a row? head she wins, tails i lose. wait a minute...",[he stops and starts realizing something]
10,16,4,27,i forgot to pick up my dry cleaning!,
10,16,4,37,"huh, if i had to guess i'd say rachel is putting on the bubble wrap and phoebe is doing the punching.",
10,16,8,3,i really made you think about that thing uh?,
10,16,10,15,lucky bastard!,[still very emotional]
10,16,11,3,"all right, let's think about this. i mean, there's got to be an explanation. uh... did you do anything to make her mad?",

10,17,3,7,"yeah, i figure they'll love it at the new house, you know? it has that big backyard. and then, when they get old, they can go to that special farm that chandler took the other chick and duck to.",
10,17,3,9,yeah. it's a shame people can't visit there.,

10,17,6,32,"hey, you know what might help?",
10,17,8,1,"it's a... it's a ""welcome home"" sign for the baby.","[he holds up a white poster with huge red letters. it reads, ""welcome home baby."" there is also a huge red stain on the left of the poster.]"
