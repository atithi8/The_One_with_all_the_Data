7,13,9,0,earl,"okay, so…no toner today. thanks anyway, bye-bye.",
7,13,9,2,earl,well…i only have one thing to do today. i guess i could push it back.,"[he looks at his board in his office that reads, ""today’s tasks: kill self.""]"
7,13,9,4,earl,"it’s just that i uh, have been working for ten years now at this meaningless, dead-end job and nobody here even knows i exist!",
7,13,9,6,earl,i-i’m sorry?,
7,13,9,8,earl,"oh yeah? i work in a cubicle surrounded by people. i’ve been talking to you for five minutes now about killing myself and no one’s even looked up from their desk. hang-hang on. hey everybody! uh, i’m gonna kill myself! i’ll get back to ya. i got nothing. wait. uh, hey marge! ehh, nothing. nothing.","[to the people standing around his cubicle.] [there’s no response; no one even looks up.] [to phoebe] [he sets the phone down.] [mimes putting a gun to his head, pulling the trigger, and splattering his brain on the wall behind him. then points to himself. marge watches this, then goes back to work.] [to phoebe]"

7,15,8,19,cecilia,yeah but jessica doesn’t have an english accent.,
